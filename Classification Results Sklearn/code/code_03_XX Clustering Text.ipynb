The novel talks about a child and his father, a Kuwaiti mother and a Filipino society does not accept it to begin with the events of the story since his father married his mother. The novel he wrote a beautiful style sometimes punctuated by simple popular language without cost and the writer's ability to describe a great place and time. Not surprised at the description of the writer for his country but impressed by his description of the Philippines like actually recorded a true story and briefed on the history of the Philippines!. Some of the events of the novel bold and talked about things that may be strange in society or not be addressed in this way: prison, stateless, third sex .. etc. The novel permeates some surprises, which may make you re-read some of the events of the novel again! Although the pages approached ??? Page, but it's fun right. The writer tried to shed light on many of the negatives in society from the point of view and in his own way and quickly beats the alarm without going into much detail. Many of the topics addressed by the writer deserves each other and that the novel was plentiful and the complexity of their subjects had made up the novel, but he shed light on the art. Did not Asetseg some of what was written in the novel, especially what is happening in the prisons and I think there is an exaggeration to refer to this subject. I admit that I did not understand how the novel to be translated from the Filipino author Kuwaiti! Is it true or that the writer deliberately made us imagine that a real novel!. I felt from the first pages of the novel that Jesus is the hero actually exists and is actually talking about his life to the degree has become a dream Bahaddatha!. Who wanted to look for the Filipino community Kvlpina or wanted to look for the Kuwaiti society as a foreigner or a citizen he read this novel and will not repent. Wonderful novel make me look for other novels of this author giant, thank my wife Ohdaia this novel.\n",

      "Book: Azazel .. Author: Youssef Zeidan .. Publisher: Dar Al Shorouk .. Number of Pages: 468 pages .. Entrance :. The novel takes place about an Egyptian monk named \"Hibiya\" and his travels in order to reach the truth of the Christian religion and its origins, the novel tells us the many doubts Hibiya his questions, and the frequency and variability between doubt and certainty, and faith and disbelief. The novel tells the story of the conflict with the self-Christian conflicts and disputes about the truth of Christ, the novel tells of the disadvantages of religious fanaticism, and how people can kill in cold blood in the name of religion! Positive points :. 1. Although I am not sure what is stated in the novel of historical information, but I enjoyed what I read, especially the ongoing conflict between Christianity and the pagan and between Christians and Christians themselves and differences ecclesial about the nature of Christ, and the evolution of the Christian sectarian conflict and then the drafting of faith in the law of the Christian, all this was something new to, so I was impressed by what I read, but again must investigate the truth of what is written and read .. 2. style Youssef Zidane in the novel is excellent and the way the narrative is good, Alosoufat fantastic, I did not feel really bored while reading .. 3. journey HEPA himself and his travels and his questioning of his questions and was exciting, as well as a discussion of his conversations with HEPA and Azazel, who I think it is an inner soul of man he is and in which it has an interesting and Alih- and argumentative .. negative points :. 1. porno, porno, porno ...! I am surprised why Arab writers continue to follow such a cheap week to attract readers !! Tacky style and plopped frankly, especially if many pages devoted to him, such as Youssef Zidane did in his novel where he devotes two full chapters to explain what took place between Hepa and Octavia adventures of an emotional explanation accurate detailed !!! This is without mentioning explanations for the past Martha disgusting !!!. I do not know what is really calling for this ?! The author can indicate a passing reference to what happened between the characters of his novel without having to elaborate on the description of each and every movement of connecting and meze, or to engage in such outrageous Alosoufat immoral has become commonplace !!!. 2. I felt upset and stupid after it discovered that the novel were not translating ancient manuscripts as claimed by Yusuf Zidane in the introduction to the book, and stressed that some of the footnotes from the chapter to another in addition to the pictures at the end of the book, which leaves no doubt that what you read is already translating ancient manuscripts It was recently unveiled! It felt cheap, my shock trick was already big, it was worth Yoosuf Zidane that it shows at least at the end of the book instead of fooling the reader in this way .. 3. Hypatia did not take her right in the novel as a personal fact that unlike Octavia fictional character that singled her Youssef Zeidan two full chapters did not need them: /. 4. also Azazel himself did not take a large part of the novel, something unfortunate fact that his conversations with Hyypia is most Hdtna where .. exit :. Acetate of deception whose work Youssef Zidane in his version of the reader, and reached a maximum with my dismay arrived for classes, \"Octavia\" and \"Martha\" !. Novel \"Azazel\" I do not see the cause of the commotion that was going around, perhaps the reason lies in the emergence of the sectarian with addressing the conflict between Christian denominations, but I do not think that Joseph Zidane is the first to speak in this matter. I generally I would advise them not to what it from obscenity .. something \"Azazel\" :. - \"In life and in the whole universe, everything circled back to what it started, and interferes with its contact.\". - \"Writing raises heart and self-contained storms, reservoirs memories, and irritation of the horrors of reality we have.\". - \"Man, however, is weak, we faint not force us only with love.\". - \"an act of prayer wizardry, they are stages of life, and the heart Mahzon hangout.\". - \"we should not shy away from something imposed on us, no matter how, as long as we did not Nqtervh.\". - \"There is no higher in the world to pay the pain, for no man can express his pain.\". - \"word may do in human money doing powerful drugs, they are not immortal life corruptible death Qailha.\".

Sun calls love for all faith that goodness exists in all but I did not see that he presented this to Aladdin, and all that Artjah the other is to love and accept his father to him .. The other thing is dealing with Kimia despite her young age, it was possible to Atmnha his love and understand the secret of his treatment of those but he chose cold treatment left in the cycle of grief and Anksarha .. the novel is worth reading and I would recommend that you read the heart and let your feelings control, do not mind and analyze every word and phrase in which Vanma we will find what we do not agree in any novel. I do not know how accurate the details of the life of Rumi and Shams in this novel, but I determined not to read more about their lives together.\n",

And know about his move from his mother's house after her marriage to one of his father's killers later because he does not violate their religion !, will move to the house of his uncle and decides the migration to Alexandria to complete the study of medicine and theology in one of its monasteries. Here Hepa begins in the description of Alexandria and its people and their situations and nature in a way distinct Jadda..ontaba after a meeting in which Baoctavaa..walta dwell Ashaba we will come back to him Ahaka..tm left her knowledge after he was a Christian monk and not bend Mthelha..tm only \"almost\" with his meeting Hibata..tlk scientist unfortunately philosopher Alazimh..walta has not received her luck in dwell Kaoctavaa.

Also, which makes the novel more credible is to delve into some of the details of life that was devoid of it these are novel, even encounters an aura by Talal was simplified and fast-fetched, even though it is from a conservative society girl tribe also said more than once and is, so I see that the novel became just meetings gathered between them .. just what I like in the novels of dreams they are based on the history of some of the Algerian personalities and tales that are usually more realistic than the tales heroes themselves, such as the story of her brother Alaa and its owner Alnder.\n",

Another is why the writer avoided that reminds us any country events took place and any time! It was more worthy of them until the picture is complete in our minds. \"You are me\" is a light summer break for me, I spent a good time with it .... generally story can serve as a successful television series draws especially teenagers.

First I was writing a novel in the same time jamming technique was afraid. And the second is that the first episodes were not interesting, but full of political Baltgarirah of the reality in which we live. He stopped for a year until the writer ended his novel and I finished my novel. The publication of his novel did not publish the novel. And I go back to read from the beginning .. Maybe darkness passed on the first twenty episodes in the same monotony. And even the subsequent events. The whole work exasperate me the existence of an intellectual Izz al-Din. I did not like the presence of the writer himself in the work, describing himself scientific and low-key and persistent attempts to rehabilitate young people thinking. It did not flee me gravity only when his relationship Bmervat emerged. Then the big surprise: the Ripper. Frankly, I felt that the personal wearer violently with converged Ahsata beloved \"Colonel Aureliano Bowen friendly\" the most important figure in the Hundred Years of Solitude One most important feature figures in history. This part is the most important and the best part of the novel. Not for his professionalism fiction writer Ahtqz Baltgarirah. But because he jumped out of character style and outside expectation. And also because I love you as Aureliano and I loved excused Dmoath and incest Adhirth. And I am curious at the same time of writing my novel I wrote an article \"Inspector Basha\" and Dmmth novel. The article written on the occasion of the presidential election, and he was saying that the solution in someone like intellectual Izz al-Din. So I felt that the personal, like the novel. It is something from me and intellectual. It is true that Izz al-Din was not a solution but a step on the road will instruct them must. Something like the Mosque of garbage. Abhor it and can not life without. But so bloody thought the nations. We already want everything without paying the price it is impossible. Either happy animal or a person you want to pay a bill in progress that generations after you without being blessed with freedom yourself .. by the end of Izz al-Din promised to the monotony of the novel until the end. He was not convinced that this \"discourse\" writes in twenty-four hours. It does not read in twenty-four hours. But is the means envisaged by the writer to tell his work. But is the life story of a homeland or a story? Overlap sometimes succeeded and sometimes failed. There are some paragraphs unnecessary. But the thing that it is in effect a message to the father of his son. Some tips and explanations that were not observed in my life. I took after I finished the novel repeatedly listened to the song \"Father & Son\" for Cat Stevens or Yusuf Islam .. I am still in my opinion when the writer. It is one of the writers who strongly respect them so I wish all the time that I like the novel. But the second novel I read to him, and I feel politician wants to explain his vision and expectations and its sciences in the novel. Always political action falls in private direct he writes about the decision-making circles. Such as the fall of the Patriarch and Tais ceremony. Not spared from direct here, but vaccination work creativity is the difficult task undertaken by any writer political novel. It is not a personal assassin to say it is an ordinary novel ..

Author Lin interesting style attracts you to read the book despite the many details and bifurcation wide in the events. The book in its entirety bold special Muslim writer. As mentioned is not a struggle between good and evil among human beings, but also extends the psychological conflict, which passes all the people. Now to you may not find anything special in what I say about this novel, but really distinctive is the daring Muslim writer to enter into the life of the old monastic very precise details on the tongue of his hero Egyptian monk Hepa. His research has been rich and interesting to see the strong conflicts that took place in ancient times between the major churches in Alexandria and Rome and Constantine. Infiltration by the writer for Agile plotting easily Alkinsoah conflicts in the foundations of the doctrine of the Christian religion and is already thorny issue of paints a picture of the manifestations of violence and cruelty and paper and love of that era characteristic time. And carried out to the many details of the monastic life and the corresponding difficulties of secularization and psychological conflicts and general human sins carried by Azazel trying to shirk his responsibility as a human being weak and sin affects. The book has some paragraphs that may be considered shocking to some readers and may not fit some of the ages and but also to contain different feelings and mixed with intense love and pain continued along the years and suffering and Kve feelings and betrayal and weakness and cruelty ... a group of high-end highlights the weakness of human feelings and human desires to surrender often.

      "In the name of of Allah the Merciful. The first thing attracts you to a novel Azazel is its name, which puts on the minds of many people often wonder, especially those who did not once Christianity read the theology and ancient languages ​​.. Before you consume confusion and play in you surmises Dr. Youssef Zeidan the author of the novel in the sense the name in the first novel comes to make you think the reason for choosing the biggest eagerly .. choosing the name Azazel of the novel is itself a superior concrete author he is this choice made me think always the influence of the devil on the main character of the novel, a monk Hepa, and made me at the same time enter him in the dialectics of the responsibility of the sins that took the novel from the first word where to another character out .. the novel tells the general conflicts experienced by the human in every time and any place since the creation start until the time, good Vasraa against evil and human against the devil (or against himself) is an eternal conflict, we will not reach it to the result we will not be able the Nhsm dispute is believed that it is the most important and inevitably .. this conviction is the basic idea that the author wanted to deliver according to my exposure through historical crises experienced by the Christian Church in the most times her ordeal without forgetting the opinion of the writer in this juvenile W and link them to your Bmnzawrh .. I do not want prolongation in the graduation of the goals that made the writer introduces in this narrow corridor and danger and passes through the ambushes of the Church especially Christianity and that he is not a Christian but a Muslim, the world's poor novel will reveal each person dimensions are not known to others and may not be intentional writer Himself.. ----------. Historically novel. Perhaps the most helped the author to love his version of this strong form of full history knowledge and comprehensive expertise and specialization in ancient manuscripts, all were unanimous that what is listed in this novel of historical events was true and very accurate and this confirms the credibility of the author and reinforces his views that went to it .. - ---------. What attracted me most prominent in the novel :. - phrases and words used by the writer had been swimming between the ease and depth without prejudice to any of them and gave the reader an area of ​​beautiful thinking of meanings between the lines .. - the way the novel The secret account of the secrets of their success Valmtgay finds himself in the pure pleasure which moves with Hepa between cities and times without complexity but interesting manner and calls for a complete reading of non-stop .. - the writer has succeeded in moving the minds of readers by leaving many spaces to guess extrapolation without prejudice to logically story .. - it remains the idea of ​​the struggle for power and classify religious cloak of the dilemmas of religious institutions throughout history and the writer really excelled in delivering this meaning when he described the church between Alexandria and Constantinople disputes or Nestorius and Cyril .. - described the scenes in the novel marked by persuasion hadeeth monk himself and what he sees and what Echtlj in Doakhlh and conflicts that beset Bugeanh as well as the surroundings of the events Kaalaqath women's scenes were killed Hypatia up to the reader and make it live events of the novel .. - pagan conflict - Christian or Christian - Christian reminds me of much conflict existing between the Islamic sects, including contemporary and between each other and between them and others .. - Behind the people drift who wear religious dress and their views without a deep understanding of the purposes that encapsulate these views it is one of the dilemmas of life which can not be surpass only by giving intellectual spaces for people without restricting their ideas and not to engage in issues of drift behind the opposing views strong The curriculum imposes itself .. - the preceding paragraph It does not mean leaving the rope at liberty but not exceed the institution's role, a supervisory role monitoring. It is true that such a speech could have been left by some of the cases that will be affected negatively, but I think that they all come out for us a generation can distinguish good from bad and has the ability to choose from without being influenced by others opinions directly .. - in the last three Terrapins entered with Hepa in a philosophical conflict is too deep and the size of the conflict imposed by the writer on the reader and gave him a summary of a beautiful all the events of the novel in the intelligent nonfiction distinguished writer creator .. - the end of the novel was one of the most what distinguished her word (free) used by the flame in another Tdwinath open the door wide for the reader to put what he wants endings that came out of his reading of the novel .. - it became clear to me that I did not know much too much about Christianity and I had to go back to some references to understand the meaning of many of the terms contained in the novel .. - Finally, this novel is a new horizon for me and I opened doors for me I did not imagine that I shall be opened day and encouraged me to read more about the subject and also made me think of actually reading the rest of the books of Dr. Zidane ..

      "Cheap and half did not Itauany my heart to Ghebrha three Fjbernha to-two. Features that I see. 1-novel interesting so great that I had spent 6 hours almost continuously until Anhiha. But he said the right and longing to end more events or method so that there are pages you do not read them originally. 2. The novel argumentative multifarious any that you remember whenever you find small details are very possible you open the prospects for other possibilities. My comment on the novel simply. 1. I hated how much similes there is certainly philosophers persuaded Ahmed Murad that the strength of the novel you measured similes and metaphors by tools. 2. Of course, how much I hated words and gestures, which often did not have a place of expression may not return the writer to use it. 3. I will respect the novel so much more if he continued psychological line and not drift into the world of magic and metaphysics and Sprite. Bahs It's like a dream Ptimh (Elly Barda one Probabilities due to the disappearance of another elephant blue tablets) which get rid of those to themes of the whole node without having to find a logical solution may have been difficult for you after the complexity of events. 4. describe the details of the hero's life to the point of eating and drinking are many details but I swallowed perhaps planting is used then either enter the bathroom with him to stand together we see all the details pisses -Are you ask me in this? 5. I do not know how I was impressed by the novel girls and how we did not come out of women's rights Baayl associations with so much contempt by women. In the eyes of the writer is a machine installed or is the object lustful all his problem or sex whore. Or at best traitorous leave her husband at midnight to tell with how a former lover that her life without punishment, although she said that her husband is Mvyehosh defect. 6. similes, which quotes from the Koran to what is described by the most despicable in the novel. Is it from the door, for example, religious culture .. Sorry, but hundreds of things the novel is incompatible with any culture then this is a religious Koran and these months of similes and thus it is not a culture. Truth be told, and I do not know I do not want to accuse one in a religious but thrown B_bhet this garbage in the Koran plate is not appropriate. 7. The last dialogue with Nael is a dialogue about the devil themes of, God, like the devil advocate. Or dialogues Lucifer from God, which has been much discussed in the Western literature. , But in the end, dare to God Almighty and I did not find justification nor even a dramatic addition because the writer that supports speech Valastaazh and the Koran will not expel the genie does not affect him, but what affects the charm of the Kabbalah is of origin Jewish because this is the magic of numbers accepted it. If we passed all this and we came to the end of the ridiculous and the most absurd analysis of the topic as a whole, we find that there are points in the novel demolish all possible scenarios ... 1. supposed to be Basma carried from Nael and not Sharif and despite this Basma aborted (upon detection of the body load was aborted because of violence overload with it before her death if Mafeesh abortion report supposed pregnancy has not completed her death or stillbirth says, but bleeding and abortion ?? !!!!) while marriage is supposed to reap the de mankind makes carrying carry not miscarry. Is this the meaning of that Basma carried Shirreff and that all his thoughts about the child who kill her in all cases Vostbakh is wrong. 2. Whether or six house Basma both felt something strange to happen because of the violence and the husband sadism case where it is in dealing with them as we see Lubna at the top of her happiness after two years with Nael as it seems. Or is this confirmation that Taima Nael also likes to build and do all this for her and this is different from the others with it. 3. Sharif was in a period of wear Nael him wake up for short periods every few days or every day to feel this was the problem, but do you wear Nael Yahia for two years without waking up once? 4. The tattoo is Merpt Jana marriage pair tattoos have been removed from the body of Basma I will utterly did it did not stop or tattoos just bring not lifting the magic only kill the dog. 5 I think that there was a link between Nael and Yahya from the beginning and above all (perhaps touching only and not full wear) the words of Maya when she told him you mesh normal. The patient, who he saw and spoke to him, and is deceased and the black dog, which was shown to him and visited, but how this happened while his wife did not put tattoos or cursed that Maya was put, and we do not know. There is a kind of novels The end of open several scenarios acceptable. This beautiful but true for this kind and a genius all events must be consistent with each scenario of them do not find what Enaweh or ruined, and here lies the genius. As for which it is in our hands failed to diversify this type because it is really unbearable Azh all scenarios without exception and refuting Mahdomh position or event in the novel\n",

Forty 6.ohieddi Translator \"Mohammed Darwish,\" as well as additions and explanations in the footnote, helped me a lot in understand some of the problems .. negative points :. 1.qsh desert flower in the first chapter came in its name is not completely logical !! She would tell when she was seven years old, and how she died her mother giving birth to her brother, also spoke about the wrath of her father from her brother and loaded the cause of the mother's death, the desert flower says her father married after only one year of the death of her mother, and the father and new wife Asaian treated her brother than It forced him to escape from the house -amrh one year here! -. Then the killing of her father's brother and his new wife, the desert flower says she was thirteen, which means that her brother was six years old! Rational he is able to submit a murder, which in this age !!!!. 2.qsh ELLA and Aziz did not Trgueni a lot and I felt some boredom in the classrooms, so always what I was trying to finish them quickly to go back to the story of the main .. 3.qdarat sun piercing and irrational, we are not in the process of a fictional novel or beyond nature, but we find that the writer when you talk from the sun like someone talking about space: / Beginning with his vision of angels as a child! And then throwing books into the water and dry out without a drop !! And finally with his knowledge of things unseen !!! Also Kimia that possess the ability to speak with spirits and ghosts! come on!!. 4.alkatebh spoke about the mystic and I think frankly thought that the novel is to consolidate and disseminate this more thought than the story of the events between Shams and Rumi. Among these ideas contained in the novel is that the heart is the foundation and the mind is important, Valsofih separated between the heart and mind and always prefer heart and never! With God in his book addresses the minds of the people above all, piña and mind are inseparable, but complement each other .. 5.oadha among the Sufi ideas sufficiency without God's love interest in the application of his law ?! Luxury contradiction !!. It does not matter if you drink alcohol, your heart is locked, it does not matter to walk in the ways of vice and your heart pure and full of love for your Creator! It does not matter anything you do, whether it was halal or haram, as long as your heart pure !! I do not know how you can love your Lord and you claim to violate his orders and disobey him?!. 6.lm Ostsg personal sun a lot, I saw a contradiction between what he believes and between the said and done and dealing with people! And even methods to impose his ideas have not lived up to me .. 7.nhih characters of the novel was vague! Did not know what happened to Ma and flower desert nor a murderer, as if Chavaq rushed eventually and wrote hastily, until the end of the story of Ella and Aziz was quick and did not take their efficiency .. 8. I see that Chavaq exceeded the lines of red should not exceeded in some things and Alosoufat, and will not dwell in He mentioned the one who read the novel will know what I am talking .. director :. The idea of ​​the novel is very beautiful, but it was not successful writer in some put forward to explain this idea and consolidation, and this is what makes me say that this novel you can lift them or reduce them according to your analysis of what I have read and understood. Weak scrutiny of some of the stories contained in this novel was revealed from its beauty like desert flower story, and it was incumbent on Chavaq to take notice of such a thing! Ideas in this novel is not all of them as fruitful and productive, and when one must read it to investigate and pay attention to what .. read some of the \"rules of love Fortieth\" :. -Fly Despite what people say, it is not feeling the love, but only tormented would come and go quickly .. -valepeshr tend to Alastkhav all that can not afford to understand !.

Onsna of Palestine Andalus again?!. I do not want, I do not want to pass the question to mind more!. We are all born to find a state there in the far north is called \"Spain\" Muslim tipped it from Europe where ancient history shows it. Some monuments, in a period of time shortly after he arrived the Muslims of our ancestors, and we heard the name of \"Al-Andalus\" to be ancient history was a day the spirit of civilization and its origin, and suddenly became pal ... have not studied or hear in our schools only about Fatah al-Andalus and its leaders the names of those who arrived from Maghreb countries for this new land. And disappeared of Andalusia, and disappeared heroes of books and tales, despite all the grandeur that surrounded who conquered Andalusia, I always think that Salibia the region the right to defend their land and recover whatever Muslims treat them well, the land is their land and the right that they have a right to defend , so long as it was my belief that as fate of the State of Spain should now be on those land who carried the Christian religion, a large majority and the rule of some Muslims came from the Maghreb, have not read before and did not study the fall of Andalusia, yes, there in the distant years of Andalusia fell, and it ended up !. I realized these words that the fall of Andalusia really was the fall of the homeland! I felt that the Arabs belonging as his image of the novel was not an immigrant affiliation! , What they suffered there in Andalusia was not the suffering of someone who can return at any time to Fez, Tunisia, Egypt, Damascus, Jerusalem and others, I realized that the delivery of the cities was only the beginning, and that the deportation of Muslims after it was not a punishment in terms of forcing the Christianization of the from the left of the people of Andalusia !, evangelize people and hide them for their survival on the religion of Islam, the presence of the Muslims of Andalusia for Mass churches every day for tens of years, for generations to create generations on religion and the new language in public, and the religion of the ancestors and their language in secret, seizing books and burning them, preventing civilization that lived where al-Andalus for years, though, all this was not a punishment in front of the recent deportation decision, which was issued against Arabs after Tnasroa!. Examined the articles openly find an explanation panacea to what I read, and I felt, until I found what refreshed me and grabbed my breath at the same time, the fact that Fatah al-Andalus was the fact that overturned all the beliefs of the Christians of the old country, it has been most of the population carrying our Christian resemble in many of the principles of the Muslim religion and the entry of Muslims with the injustice of the rulers to open the curtain in front of many people to hand over after the opening of Andalusia, to Andalusia became the new inhabitants were originally inhabitants and still, but they entered the new religion, to live more than five hundred years and build a civilization that has not built an unprecedented, residents of Al-Andalus were not in the majority of them Arabs migrated after the conquest, but they Andalusians land the original owners of their fathers and grandfathers, yes, so was the displacement of Muslims or convert them and displace them, so the abandonment of the sons of the land to become as \"refugees\" in the Arab Maghreb countries, and become after more than five hundred years citizens in Morocco, Tunisia and elsewhere, and so, we were born to Spain, we find there is not any right to demand that in Andalusia !. Last question I put before you, whether al-Andalus Palestina thrown in two pages in the history books ?, which attended the Palestine recite the tashahhud of that time they resemble other history Andalus this reality witnessed?!.

      "My heart Female Hebrew ... I have never been readers who are reading books electronically, but never thought to read a novel by downloading them from the Internet sites; And I am not irreproachable in my words on this reading from eating this way ... never, what is great in the conservatory not only reading books and are only the product of the great sanctity that I hold myself in the direction of the paper paper version. The most sacred paper book so much make me spend my money saved on it, and if the price of a gal. I do not say this is of course a desire to show Theraia I am not rich at all; But what I mean is to buy the paper version of the book take myself a super priority, it was some prefer to read e-books while distract his money to buy other supplies he sees first Bmalh Valomr I have the opposite; I am ready to buy a book a big return for my rejection of an amount to buy a new shirt requires the same amount, and what harness the money to get things without other than varying the order of priorities when people, and I'm not irreproachable on a ranking of priorities .. what I wrote my introduction that long only to say that I am and the time the first break base Slurp novel electronic pages, and what I did it only for the reason express raised Thairta .... in my heart Female Hebrew, I heard about this novel nearly a year or more, the views of all my acquaintances around a positive and largely classified by many within their stories favorite ... pointed out some reading, but I do not know did not sensed enthusiasm never to proceed in the matter was then adjourned subject until I read a few days before the suspension of one of the readers, that the novel is not good, and that was the first negative comment ... read it in its own caught curiosity fire inside me that it was for me to comment an opinion anomaly, everyone I know who praised the magnificence of the novel, it was not me but to read them electronically for not providing the current paper book my desire to resolve the matter of this novel. Today I finished reading, and I joined with a negative opinion with regard to the novel and did not stop myself from that gladden Connie did not spend my money to buy a novel like this ... Thank God, Mali did not go in vain .. it is important, now and after this lengthy introduction, which Artoatha necessary for Bouh and what is inside me to clarify my position completely, I will explain why now giving me the novel two stars out of five stars and will be in my burning for some important events in the story for anyone who wants to see them. First, it tells the story of a young Muslim man -maharb in the ranks of the Lebanese resistance against the Israeli-forces in love with a Jewish girl. The question that arises here is: How can the reader understand the occurrence of a young Muslim man in love with a Jewish girl without taking this first weighty political considerations and religious Alforac? In addition, the fact that the young Ahmed is not an ordinary Muslim, but is a warrior against Israeli forces ... I tried it Astaaab despite dyslexia but the writer made to swallow arguments such as the fact that the young Jewish Nada has the morals and principles make them beautiful rebel against a group of things that are not accepted in the practices of the people of their religion ... I accepted it a little .... Second, the writer talked about the love of Ahmed Nada, but between them was not love at all, what was more like a deal between unilateral action side and let me put it; Young person Ahmed has not progressed to a sermon Nada convinced her and respected him Jewish doctrine that claimed initially -lndy and Ohlha- it will not try to tamper with, but offered to her for the purpose of the opposite of what was approved, its purpose this represented in his desire to convince Nada religion of Islam and to invite him ... and this lie hit the wall the meaning of love also canceled all considered the same Jewish girl what was attracted to it only to an end in himself sees a noble but I see a false hypocrite .. III found is incomprehensible and is receptive to my family and Nada Ahmed agrees on this link ... Let us say that love took the hearts of heroes but what about the families? How Jewish family that Magma Muslim family accepted at a time when much political and religious conflicts between Israel and Lebanon ... Despite all the arguments presented by the author, but I was not convinced at all what happened ... Valomr far cry from the ratification and had to prolong and elaborate a lot in the arguments Perhaps the reader is convinced .. Fourth: I talked writer about a Muslim girl named Rima grew up in the confines of a Jewish family ensured sponsored, after Rima not reached certain decided to wear the Islamic veil but dogged wear at home also ... attributed to the fact that the man who lives with him at home remains a strange man, nevertheless being Hadhanha and educators ever since she was a child and a small although he considered closer to him than his children Alachrin- permission must wear the veil even in his presence, but it has reduced its communication with him, and between them have created a significant barrier .. . at this point, the writer reported that the Jewish family that ensured under the auspices of Rima changed its treatment of her, the fact that the latter different from them ideologically with that this is not true at all, what was the change in the treatment of \"Jewish father\" to his daughter Rima only the product of the actions of the new Rima and exotic, and that the writer showed that Islam is a religion which has been Stressed too, and I did not like this at all, as I did not like to be photographed Rima as a victim of a lack of acceptance disagreement by ideological family, \"Jacob\" because it was not the case and only did not Tkfloa them originally from the beginning? Fifth: The girl has been Rima hesitation on the ears of her father, Jacob, who guaranteed since her childhood words such as: \"I call on you for guidance, do not want you to enter the fire.\" What is this racism towards the Jewish religion? How the writer allowed herself to pass the idea on the lips of personal Rima, the idea that it does not condemn the religion of Islam is the inevitable fate and Errant will fire? How can you give such a serious suggestion, as if her hand keys to heaven and Hell? What Odraha that God forgives all sins for a Jew to enter the wider doors of paradise in exchange for a Muslim to enter Islam condemns the wider fire doors? Jews classified as unbelievers and disbelief that I think the term should not be launched only on those who know the truth but refuse to follow, despite his knowledge of them, and was not a father who Rima to ensure her familiar with the fact that the writer to adopt its sovereignty avers he is an infidel. And the description which she described him as guilty and to enter fire only evidence that they pass racist messages against other religions as they speak tongue is not neutral at all trying to emphasize that the only righteousness right is Islam and that other methods astray. It had to follow neutral in her words to leave the reader field himself to discover that Islam was for him is really a religion right .. Fifth: When has the engagement between Nada and Ahmed walked the latter in the plan hatched not and is trying to convince Nada the health of Islam, and here arose Thairta great novel direction and hated pretty much ... what was going on between Ahmad and Nada was not a discussion ever taken and response between the two parties, but it was a religious indoctrination strictly being taught Ahmed Nada, did not come for discussion as claimed writer, but the only one who speaks and bothered me so much was that the writer showed that all the Jews who talked about them in the story as if they were stupid can not keep up with Ahmed to speak, and do not offer, and if a single evidence of the health of their religion .. the tipping the whole debate in favor of Ahmed and was not originally a discussion because I am, and as I said, Ahmed was the only speaker as he was coming sporadic arguments I did not like the Muslim reader, what about non-adherents of Islam .... the days passed and signed a lot of developments converted to Islam on their impact Nada, the writer did not enter the details of the arguments that It made a Muslim Nada but reported that Nada examined in depth to find the way Religion itself and this is loved ... reduce the time everything was walking in the novel so well that he died members of the Nada family, and they condemn the religion of Christianity, and here comes the writer to pass racist again through the tongue of Nada, who expressed his indignation to the fact that its owner to persuade those Christians who have died of the religion of Islam, they have not tried in the eyes of Islam, then Mayton on fire astray and their fate ... jumped to the mind of Nada ideas that mission from now on Sttl_khas in the call to the religion of Islam in order to avoid the entry of fire .. loved ones and here committed writer the same mistake cause harm Nada with non-Muslims was a teaching without taking as the arguments based on it to support the health of Islam's theory is mostly arguments false to the fact that the views of Muslim scholars differ about the validity of whether or not ... were those arguments and flimsy incredibly. . Sixth: Nada managed to supernatural strength and amazing to convince all around Islam !!!! All individuals converted to Islam and this is not acceptable to the mind and not the logic of ... As I said at the beginning, portrayed the Jews as stupid accept under any pretext whatever ... they also did not talk in the book about how he was betrayed by them was to talk about their Islam terse It is not convincing ... increase that Nada succeeded in persuading a child Jewish religion of Islam, and here came the rule of the writer stating that the child will not be held accountable for their previous beliefs, as if referring to older newlywed convert to Islam will be held accountable former religion, and here lies in the same mistake is not and enter into the privacy of the decisions of the powers of God, which has nothing to do with them, as they portrayed so Islam as a religion is punishable even unaware and excommunicate him for not familiar with and this is not true ... that she believed in the fact that Islam was the true religion must it at least not detract from the other sanctity of religions .. Seventh: the writer and the Secretariat of the novelist excellent, her style is very interesting and fun fantasy to score, but Adiba \"failed\", a very simple language Arabic, although Arabic is distinct from the rest of the languages ​​richness and wealth, but this novel is easy to understand the degree of much of undervaluing ... the writer committed\n",

Are you likely to belong to him .... I know that the goal of the writer the benefit of readers and urged Muslims to their religion .... But we must not lose the mind of the writer that readers Antmanon to different religions and beliefs varied ... It is the right of man to his fellow man to respect religion and race and his country ... the writer was able to reach her ideas without affecting other religions ... was a writer can penetrate more in the essence of Islam, and to provide more powerful and more convincing evidence ..... the novel could be formulated better ...

To remain fond important and forcing them overwhelmed time. I think that the writer did well to talk of the logic of a man to some extent. I think a lot of shyness prevented, which detract from the sound manly. Nothing changed for the novel (loved too) nor talk of the other party is nothing. Sad because the raised preferred to confine themselves in the tale is over. I wish I was raised to love another story I wrote, for example, something that is Juman and Abdulaziz. Love may be the hardest of all the perceptions and ideas. Nothing like love salutes and something like love Yamit. One star for writing lightness and other star of the name of the novel.\n",

Start a normal relationship between them. Normal that the heroine would like to continue the relationship.

Ahmed Khaled Tawfiq inscription on the back of the cover that it historically how important information and that you have not read the history of the 1919 revolution, but I found what he said Ahmed Khaled Tawfiq. The novel simple series of historical events punctuated by the ignition until the end of the 1919 revolution or rather the killing of the revolution and heroes. Cover only one novel character shows is a snapshot and crossing other words about Egypt .. beautiful usurped by Rdecht and still pained not to bow to benefit her forced rape can not save themselves. Several novels did not read before you will find the novel superficially like any film Arabic Old presented the 1919 revolution .. the struggle and struggle and love stories hidden failed and GUANI stories and men without principle and personalities of indifference to the national sentiment shifts .. or revenge patriotism. . or from any desire of self-driven events, the national sentiment. I liked the stories of love and the novel, despite Bassatthma predicted Ahaddathma. Personalities :. Historical figures are difficult to evaluate because they evaluate a public figure and I may need several readings but other characters were the many features of humanity and that was normal.

Instead of calling for jihad outside (the war on infidels), Romy called internal Jihad (Jihad self) ».. In the first meeting between the two argued Tabrizi, the chief judge authoritarian saying:« The law like a candle, provides us with an invaluable Nora. But we must not forget that the candle will help us to move from one place to another in the dark, and if we forget where we are going and we focused on the candle, what the benefit of it? ».. When warned judge Tabrizi that fine line between words and between the pure kufr cut it sun this Tale :. «One day Moses was walking in the mountains alone when he saw a shepherd from afar. He was on his knees with his hands outstretched toward the sky to pray. It flooded Moses happiness, but when astonished approached a hears shepherd prays .. (Oh my god lover I love you more than you know, I'll do anything for you, just tell me what you want. Even if you asked me to sacrifice for you sheep fat in the gregarious I will not hesitate in so. Ochou I put fat in the rice mechanism to become taste delicious .. then Sogsl your feet and your ears cleaner and Affleck of lice. this is how much I love you more). Shouted Moses (stop, O foolish man, what do you think yourself active? Do you think that God eats rice? Do you think his feet Ngzlema? This is not a prayer. This is purely Kafr) .. apologized Shepherd. He promised to pray as pious. Moses Flmh prayer. He satisfied all the same satisfaction. On that night he heard a voice of Moses. Was the voice of God: (What did you do, O Moses? I have sprouted shepherd the poor. Not Mazaty aware of him. Perhaps he does not pray the right way, but it is sincere in saying, that his heart was pure and his intention good. I am satisfied with it. May be his words to your ears as Hamlet, but for me was disbelief sweet) .. understand his mistake of Moses, and in the early morning he returned to the mountains to find the shepherd prayed but the way that Moses taught them. In order to perform the prayers properly it was stammering lacking passion and enthusiasm as he did previously. Moses patted on the back: (O my friend, I have sinned, please forgive me. Please pray as you pray before. Prayers precious and precious it was God). He did not want to return the old shepherd to his prayers, did not adhere to the official prayer of Moses, which taught them. A new way to communicate with God has been discovered. Although he was satisfied and happy with the naive faith has now exceeded that stage, after Hamlet sweet ».. Tabrizi seal:« As you can see not control the way people communicate with God, each man his way and his prayers own. God does not take us our word, but look at the depths of our hearts, not the rituals or rituals that make us believers, even if our hearts pure or not ».. novel that link between the past and present linked stunning not yet Onhaa, but fascinated them pushed me to write about them, adapted some of its parts to invite you to enjoy your predecessor.

Baby moment ».. and respond to it ELLA trendy« strange to say that a woman is considering a lot of the past and think more about the future, and somehow untouched by the moment ».. conclude these quotations with the words beautiful to my heart, written by Aziz to ELLA heroine of the novel« I to find you love when not to expect »..

      "What really raises my dismay ..anh how a person can fill 100 or 200 sheets for love only. In my opinion, the novel-Almtoada- must combine several elements not only a group of pages revolving around (at least two Habboo Bed..trko Bed..aurerdjao for some j). The novel fun -broaa Almtoada- must combine drama or Action or Algmodhao Jerimh..k key, for example, as events. And the love story happened to be a secondary important novel. The story does not love or be a major focus of stories that ..vchar dry and monotonous without any diversity of the novel or Mphajat..atmany that I find Aomaroaah makes me convinced that the novels of love and fun and full of disciplined Bamufajat..la you back as you read them before. Despite this very respected style writer who I'm seeing a new style and intelligent reject .. what made me finished reading the novel, despite all He..olzlk only the second star earned.
