Summary: The Plot for The Giver
     The plot for the book The Giver is very confusing. Their world in this book is all perfect and there is no crime or anything unusual. The beginning you really don't know what is going on because it kind of starts right in the middle of something. There world is totally black and white. The main character Jonas starts out as any normal boy would until the age of 12 when he gets the special job as the Receiver. This person receives all the memories from the people in the past. All the people in this book do not suffer any pain except the receiver. Everybody has the same exact feeling as everybody else and don't get to think for themselves. The second reason is that the plot in this book is not a very interesting topic. This book doesn't grab your attention at all. It is all perfect so there is really no adventure in this book. There also isn't any action in it which makes this book even more boring. This book's plot isn't very thought out in my opinion because it is not very interesting and it is all perfect which makes the reader think the author didn't put much time into thinking the plot through by having the book all perfect. There is what I think about the plot of the book The Giver. So now that you know that this is a very bad book! I want to make sure that you don't waste your well earned money. Thanks for reading about what I have to say about the plot of this book.
