Summary: THERE &amp; BACK AGAIN
     AWESOME book! Originally Tolkien wrote it for his children, now everyone of every age loves it. I don't want to spoil the story, other than it is a really good treasure hunt. If you're stuck on which edition to get, I'd suggest getting the 'classic' one with Tolkien's full-color paintings included. (It's nice and cool, and may be worth something down the road.) On the cover it shows his drawings of the mountains, forest, etc... Enough of that, I just hope they'll adapt this as a movie... (crosses fingers)
