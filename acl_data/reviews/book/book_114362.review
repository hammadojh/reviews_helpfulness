Score: 1.0/5.0

Summary: Randomness
     Did I miss something here? What in the world was this book about? How can anyone say it even has a plot, let alone is worthy of being considered a classic? This pessimistic teenager gets kicked out of school (his third one) for not applying himself. You get the idea that he's smart, but he just doesn't care about anything. There are random references to his dead brother Allie, maybe that's a cause for his disillusionment with the world, but it's never really verified. This story was disappointing in that nothing significant happened. I kept waiting, and turning the pages, but at the end of the day it was a disappointment.
