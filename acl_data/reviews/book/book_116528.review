Summary: pseudo-intellectual and not interesting
     Atlas Shrugged is clearly an attempt to legitimize global capitalism, but not, as is suggested, the free market kind, but the worst form of corporatism. The philosophical arguments are convincing only to those who have not read much in the subject. If you are interested in this topic, there are a hundred other books that are more educational and interesting, including most dry econ. texts. It is not worth the time to read this 1000 pages of propaganda...
