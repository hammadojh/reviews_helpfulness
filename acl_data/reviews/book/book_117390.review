Summary: A Dangerous Work
     I've recommended this book to any number of people since coming late in life to it. This is the refutation of Marx's &quot;Communist Manifesto&quot; - the powerful rationalist and ethical argument for capitalism. But you'd be amazed how many supposedly intelligent, open-minded people have told me they REFUSE to read this book because they disagree with its basic premise: that capitalism - the belief that free people creating and freely exchanging wealth - is a moral good, and that communism - the belief that what you create belongs not to yourself, but to everyone else (i. e., government-sanctioned thievery) - is evil. They actually seem AFRAID to read it; they seem to have a lurking, fear that this book somehow threatens some cherished core belief. Who would have thought that simply READING a book could be dangerous?If you read nothing else this year, read this book - if you dare. But know that doing so will put your beliefs about how the world works under a pitiless microscope. And if you read it with any kind of an open mind, it will change the way you think.
