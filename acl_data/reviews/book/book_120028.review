Summary: It's all in the attitude
     For those who read this book with an open Mind and Heart, you will benefit the most. This book is all about attitude, if you have a bad attitude about life and living then this book isn't for you, but if your living your best life and want it to be better, then there is much to be taken from the SECRET. It isn't all about the "Stuff" you can have, but the VERY BEST LIFE YOU CAN HAVE.......that makes it all worth reading.
