Score: 3.0/5.0

Summary: overrated
     I wish I would have been so intelligent. I believe this is a compilation of all of the self help and motivational stuff I have read or heard before. I won't say that I didn't enjoy it, I was just a little disappointed. No new territory uncovered. I think what I have heard Oprah say about it is right on and better put. I am a true believer in "Creative Visualization". I like Shakti Gawain.
