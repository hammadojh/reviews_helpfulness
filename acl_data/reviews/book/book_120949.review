Summary: The Secret
     This instructional book is very easy to follow. You'll find you can read it in one sitting. However, some of you may want to take notes (I did) so it will take a bit longer. Similar to other books teaching you to manifest your own destiny, it reaffirms that the best course for your life is one you create with vision and belief. I found the section on gratitude particularly comforting. Keep an open mind and you will find this book is exactly what it says it is, a shared secret. Copyright KatherinesCorner. com-for Amazon. com
