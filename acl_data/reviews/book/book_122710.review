Score: 5.0/5.0

Summary: Definitely a must read!
     I got this book for a Christmas gift and hadn't heard of it. When I read the synopses on the back I didn't think I would really like it so I thought of returning it. Before I went to the bookstore I opened the book and started reading the first chapter. I never did take the book back! The writing was very gripping and I could hardly put the book down. Although there are parts that are disturbing it's a fantastic book and it paints a vivid picture of life in Afghanistan. I would highly recommend this book!
