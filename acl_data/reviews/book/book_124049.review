Summary: I cried for 8 hours
     I started this book at 7:30 in the AM and finished at 7:30 PM. I am the mother of a 4 month old and I had to read this off and on throught the day. Given the choice I would not have put it down. I cried all day. It's a very powerful story. I especially connected with the Father son relationship in this book. It's a story that I will always remember and I highly reccomend it.
