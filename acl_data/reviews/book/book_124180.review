Summary: A hugely satisfying read
     This book is somewhat like an excellent meal--it starts out with a light appetizer in which the reader is introduced to Amir the insecure son of Baba, a wealthy man, and his best friend, Hassan whose father is Baba's servant. The reader is given an inside look at Afghan culture, including the delightful description of the kite-flying contest in which the last one with a kite in the air is the winner and the kites which are cut and fall to the ground are prized possessions for the "kite runners". A tragic and violent incident brings on the heavy, main part of the meal, and the lives of the two boys are changed forever. Unspeakable guilt and long-kept secrets work to undermine the happiness of the main characters. The dessert is the sweetness of repentance and redemption, which comes at great cost to some of the characters. The author uses the background of 30 years of political unrest in Afghanistan as a setting for characters whose lives are likewise torn up and re-invented. This is a wonderful book which I highly recommend.
