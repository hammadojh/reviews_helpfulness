Summary: Adults, Please Leave This Book Alone!
     If you are a teenager, read it. I mean it. Read "The Catcher in The Rye" now before you are too old to "read" it. As a high school student, not only did I enjoy reading this book, but I literally found my identical twin in this book; Holden Caulfield. Every single words he spitted hit my hearts as I was experiencing deja vu. I have long had so many questions that can not be, do not deserved to be, answered. Yet I do not like that answer, neither did Holden. Where do I go from here?Holden's short 3-day adventure partially pointed me out a way out and perhaps did throw out more questions on my face. This book is much more than Peter Pan Syndrome, antisocial behavior, and a "cynical adolescent". And Life is much more than schools, adults, and a sex. In a sea of neon, clocks are racing toward the mid-night, when will our souls be solaced?
