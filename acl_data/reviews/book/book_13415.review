Summary: The Hobbit: 70th Anniversary Edition
     While I really appreciate all the corrections in the text which makes the book a more enjoyable read and the addition of all Tolkien's illustrations included as he wished, I find the quality of the paper as well as the black & white drawings very poor and not up to the honor of a 70th anniversary edition. HarperCollins would have and should have done it and the quality would match the occasion.
