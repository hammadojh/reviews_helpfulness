Summary: Holes not so good
     The book that I am reviewing is Holes by Louis Sachar. I think this book is dull, one star. This book is about digging Holes at Camp Green Lake. In this book Stanley is blamed on stealing. He went to a boy camp. He made a good friend named Zero. I would not recommend this book. Emerson N. J (...)student
