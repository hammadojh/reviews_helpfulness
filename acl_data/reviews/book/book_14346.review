Summary: The Hobbit
     Bilbo Baggins is a clever, tricky hobbit who lives in Hobbiton. One day his friend Gandalf is supposed to come over for tea but some unexpected guests arrive. Instead thirteen dwarves come to his house to persuade him into going on a quest with them to drive the dragon Smaug out of their city and take his treasure. Unfortunately Bilbo does not like adventures but something deep down inside him keeps on telling him to go. Reluctantly, he decides to leave on the parlous journey with Gandalf and the dwarves. On the way they run into all kinds of creatures that slow down their pace. Will they make it past all odds and beat the undefeatable dragon? In this amazing fantasy The Hobbit, J. R.R. Tolkien takes you places you've never imagined. If you like action filled suspense stories that you can't put down then this is definitely the book for you! -Julian Thomassie
