Summary: Overcoming Faults
     This book is good read in spite of a host of faults. Its author, Dan Brown, could charitably be described as a mediocre writer of prose. The unfolding of the action moving the plot of the book forward resembles that of a crowded tram rather than a high speed passenger train. Much of this is caused by the many sections of the book where one character or another stops the action to provide an expository of arcane religious symbolism or church history (real and bogus). The paradox is that it is these expositions that make the book so interesting. Brown may be a terrible stylist, but he is a master a blending pieces of authentic information with fictional information. The result of this blending is that his characters actually construct a plausible alternative to the accepted history of Christianity which is at the heart of this novel. Such creations, at least to this reviewer, are always interesting to read about even when as in this case they are completely fictional. Incidentally, for those who think Brown's creation is real, I would suggest reading,the book, "Truth and Fiction in the Da Vinci Code" by Bart Ehrman (available at Amazon. com). Ehrman counters the bogus claims made by the characters in this novel with actual historical evidence. For those who enjoy well crafted fictional alternative histories wrapped in a bit of mystery, I would recommend this book.
