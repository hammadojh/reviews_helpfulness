Summary: From a kid that sat throught the class.
     This is what society calls good? Ive spent weeks on end by my self in situations like this and let me tell you as an adolcent teen it doenst work like that. The book over analyzes things. Like the over emphais on sex, smoking and drinking. While both are a mjor part of a teens life they do not entirely consume it. And prostition? Come on, would an 16 year old really resort to a hooker? All in all the writing was good becuase as you can probably tell i have no respect for proper english. The swearing was tried and poor, It was like a five year old trying to impress his brothers older friends. After reading the whole book im left with questions, not about what happend, but what would compell a person to write a story in this style.
