Score: 5.0/5.0

Summary: Some people clearly don't get it....
     A few comments on the book, mostly in response to the negative reviews that have been posted.1) Ayn Rand is clearly not the best writer in the world. Character development and plot within the novel are somewhat lacking.2) Fact (1) above does not take away from the fact that the message is clear and most will find quite enlightening.3) Most negative reviews posted herein appear to be from people who missed the point. COMMMUNIST IDEALS ARE NOT ENVIABLE! 4) The book is a carefully constructed series of events that could potentially transpire, should society forget (3) above. I found the book to be somewhat long and a bit dry at times as well, but it surely rates five stars for being one of the few pieces of literature that I've come across that makes a clear and well-reasoned anti-socialist argument, and does so without having to resort to a wildly fictional backdrop. For those not familiar with Ayn Rand, I recommend reading Fountainhead first. Cheers,
