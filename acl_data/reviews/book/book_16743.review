Summary: Life Changer
     This book may shatter you notion of reality and morals. It is not for the weak or timid. If this is you, please refrain from reading this book. Proceed at your own risk. I had previously read Ayn Rand's "The Fountainhead" so I had an idea of what to expect from her works. I went in with high expectations and she completely over exceeded them. Her game is on a whole another level. Although "The Fountainhead" is an awesome book, a game changer in it's own right, "Atlas Shrugged" is far superior and deeper. This book is over 1,000 pages and took me four months to finish; and I was cheating by listening to the audiobook. The main thing to take away from "Atlas Shrugged" is a philosophical understanding of morality and reason. That is the whole essence of the book.
