Summary: A Story For Our Time
     It is amazing that this book was written so long ago. The clash between government regulations and capitalism that is exaggerated by Ayn Rand is more relevant now than ever. I believe that everyone, regardless of their political affiliation, should listen to this book (or read it) ... as soon as possible. Many things are happening in our country that simply aren't sustainable. Give the book a listen. It should help shape your thoughts re: how to solve some of the more difficult problems of our time.
