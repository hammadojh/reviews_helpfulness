Summary: Well-written, but I disagree with the philosophy
     This book has been recommended to me by several people over the years, and so I finally bought and read it. It's a well written book, a very interesting work of fiction. But I completely disagree with Ayn Rand's philosophy. The lengthy speeches also get to be a bit tedious, the gigantic radio speech made towards the end made me just about pass out from boredom - it seemed to be just the same words all the other characters had spewed out in all of their individual speeches, just strung along and coming out of one character's mouth. Thanks for the recap, Ayn, but I read the words fine the first time. Otherwise, I am fond of Dagny Taggert's character. For some reason I like her practical and &quot;Ice Queenish&quot; outlook on life - this character is quite opposite from me and she was presented well enough that I felt like I could see this world through her eyes. I'm just grateful the world in this book doesn't exist, at least not to this extreme degree. There is some good social commentary in there, and some things that will (or at least should) make you think. But, it's fiction, and I don't see the real world going this way anytime soon.
