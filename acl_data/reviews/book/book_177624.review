Score: 1.0/5.0

Summary: A book for adolescents
     "The Lovely Bones" belongs in a teenage babysitter series. It pulls its punches from the beginning and asks its readers to suspend both belief and intellect. I understand the romantic appeal to the gushy-gushy set, but unless you loved the movie "Beaches," stay away.
