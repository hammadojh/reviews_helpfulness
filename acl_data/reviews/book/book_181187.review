Score: 4.0/5.0

Summary: buyer beware
     There are several sellers listed as having this book, but they will ship you the mass market paperback instead. When I tried to call amazon customer service, they were vastly unhelpful for a change. Best bet is to contact the seller BEFORE purchasing to ensure you will receive the GRAPHIC NOVEL instead of the MASS MARKET PAPERBACK. I own a copy of this graphic novel and my 6 year old ADORES this book. This is a wonderful way to get a young person interested in The Hobbit. Yes, it is abridged, but the core story line is intact and the illustrations are wonderful.
