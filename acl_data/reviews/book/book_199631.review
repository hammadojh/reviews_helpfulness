Summary: Too Profane and Incoherent to Make Sense
     I can give more than a one star rating to a book I disagree with, but this one is definitely not the one. I tried to read this with an open mind, but could not get far owing to the volume of profanity and absurd reasoning coming out of Al Franken. For example, he notes correctly that the left wing is often called the Hate-America Crowd, and then tries falsely to compare liberals' opposition to President Bush and Iraq with the earlier conservatives' opposition to President Clinton's bombing of the area of former Yugoslavia. His reasoning is silly. To begin with, the Hate America character of the left-wing long predates both administrations. Since time immemorial, left wingers have tried to blame western values and policies for the world's ills. Despite the left wingers valiant efforts, there is no credible evidence that President Bush tried to deceive the American people about Iraq. Current conspiracy theories (Bush motivated by Haliburton, by the Jews and Israel, and-who knows-maybe even motivated by little green men from Mars telling him what to do in foreign policy) are simply fantasies. In contrast, President Clinton had, over and over again, proven himself to be an inveterate liar, and thus totally unworthy of trust in military matters (or, for that matter, any matters).
