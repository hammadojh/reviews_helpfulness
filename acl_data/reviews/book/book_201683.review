Summary: Dishin' It Out
     Which is what the conservatives do so well but as their reviews show they sure can't take it! Great book with serious documentation. Democrats owe this guy a large debt of gratitude. A note to the unfavorable (conservative) reviewers who feel Al is so mean spirited: Are you aware that Al is friendly with many conservatives as evidenced by their (Jerry Falwell, G. Gordon Liddy, William F. Buckley) appearences on his since-cancelled show &quot;Lateline&quot;? Did you even read the part of the book where he speaks so nicely of Gary Bauer?
