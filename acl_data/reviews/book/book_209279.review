Summary: Why do we celebrate the personally weak in society?
     As a Gen X'er I've noticed many people my age who've grown up in the "self-help" era to become self absorbed, excuse-making adults. I found Holden Caufield to be weak of character and he reminded me of the afore mentioned people. I struggle with understanding why this particular book has been so greatly celebrated. Is it the same logic that has spawned America's fascination with society's weakest? (Dr. Phil, Jerry Springer, ect...) Are we coddling our children into becoming Holden Caufield's?
