Summary: Wonderful Novel!!
     I read the book in a matter of a few days. I had heard many things about the book being both good and bad. I decided to try the book for myself. Although, there are a few parts where the book is slow moving and even disturbing I found the book to be very interesting. It is a book that you dont really get into, or even uderstand, till it is over. You really begin to understand Suzie, the main character, by the end. It brings a new light to an explination of life after death. Althogether, I found it to be well written and interesting but I do believe it is aimed more towards a teenage audience.
