Summary: Maudlin to the max
     Kudos to Ms. Sebold for getting her first novel published and becoming a best-seller. That said, I think most people are ...in by the original premise of the novel. Some of the writing is good and Ms. Sebold clearly has talent. However, I found the book to be a difficult read (shifts in tone, unbelievable characters, plodding story-line). I guess it's a story about loss and how it affects various people. I didn't much care about any of the characters so I didn't feel their pain. The first chapter is promising and there are other bits of excellent writing, but as a whole, the novel doesn't work. Maybe she needed a better editor? There are flaws in logic (no one from her neighborhood dies and enters heaven over the eight-year span of the story? the dog dies and shows up in heaven, but not the grandmother?) And I swear some of the sentences just didn't make any sense. The mother/detective relationship was not believable. The detective was incompetent, but romancing the mother? I don't think so. I also had serious problems when the father (thanks to Susie's help) identifies the murderer. In any event, I became bored with the book and struggled to get through it. When it turned sci-fi (Susie inhibits Ruth's body) near the end, I completely lost interest. The ending ties everything up into a nice bow, but the death of Mr. Harvey (in terms of how he dies) was stupid. Again, a great premise, but not a great read.
