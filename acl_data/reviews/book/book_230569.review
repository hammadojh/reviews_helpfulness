Summary: Read it and Decide for Yourself!
     The problems that arise from objectivism are that people dogmatically accept ALL of its tenets regardless of what they actually think for themselves because it's so rooted in logic. The greatest value that was listed in this book was to THINK! to THINK for yourself. To live. To exist. Blindly accepting someone else's arguments without giving them real, actual, rational thought is pointless and worthless. That's why reading this book turns some people into bitter, horrible human beings. They don't know how to rationalize things for themselves, so once they're presented with a compelling argument, they fall into it and grasp hold of it, because they are shapeless, formless, and worthless in and of themselves. Since when does a compelling argument ever give you the excuse to totally abandon your entire previous belief system? Even just ONE example would be God. Yes, objectivist principles are contradictory to many tenets of Christianity. On the other hand, do they in any way prove that the world cannot be the result of intelligent design? Absolutely not. Despite how it may seem, everything has room for expansion of thought. There are always questions unanswered by philosophies, even objectivism, unless you simply use it as a blank slate to fill in every question you could have without THINKING on it for yourself.
