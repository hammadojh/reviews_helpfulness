Summary: How do you keep an idiot busy for hours?
     I feel The Hobbit was not only the worst piece of literature I have ever read, but the most borring. This is from a students point of view. I had to read The Hobbit for an assignment, and let me tell you, I can not even count the number of times I fell asleep while reading the book. After reading the book, I bought the cliff notes, as a last resort, and, they were even as bad as the book! No help came from them! Teachers shouldn't give students that type of book to read as an assignment, it was very difficult to understand, and I feel the book should be abridged if its going to be given out to students
