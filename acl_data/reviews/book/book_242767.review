Score: 2.0/5.0

Summary: Childish but readable
     There is no action, no underlying them, it's too gory, but, it wasn't horrible. I personally could never get through it, but I've gotten about halfway various times, and I don't care for it. The reading level is about the same a Black Beauty, which I read in second grade. However, you never get to really like any characters, and there isn't any kind of theme. As Tolkein says, if you like there-and-back again kind of books, read the Hobbit. I would recommend it to middle school boys who enjoy action figures and role playing battle games. And people with no life and lots of time.
