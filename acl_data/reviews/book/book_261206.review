Score: 1.0/5.0

Summary: Warning: Don't waste your time on this book!
     I read this book in my literatuure class and I fell asleep a lot.(If I wasn't sleeping then I wasn't paying attention). I thought it was a crappy book. It appears that most people on this review list like it but I DON'T! This was a dread to read.
