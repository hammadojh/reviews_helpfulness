Summary: A Charming Version Of A Classic
     The novel The Hobbit by J. R.R. Tolkien tells the story of a hobbit named Bilbo Baggins. He is forced to join a group of dwarves on a quest to reclaim their families' ancient treasure from the evil dragon Smaug. It is a dangerous journey and during the quest it is Bilbo who saves the dwarves on more than one occasion and finds Smaug's weak spot to get back the dwarves' treasure. Although at the beginning of the story Bilbo does not believe he can achieve the dwarves' expectations, he ends up surpassing them. Bilbo becomes the unlikely hero of the group after many an example of his courage and ability to perform under pressure. The Hobbit is a wonderful adventure, fantasy novel which appeals to all ages. It can be read as a straight adventure story by younger readers, or as a more moral story by the older reader. Tolkien has tried to ask a question of the reader: would they rather sit at home and do nothing and have a quiet existance, or go out into the world, get involved and make a difference. I would recommend this book to anyone who has a love of exciting, fantasy and adventure stories. Although The Hobbit is around seventy years old, the underlying themes of the book are ageless.
