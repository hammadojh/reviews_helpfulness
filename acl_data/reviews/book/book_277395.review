Summary: Swallowing Poison
     This book is a work of fiction contradicted by scholarly writing and historical authorities readily avilable. Yet, there is a real danger that readers will take it as historical fact swallowing whole the sensationalist writing, anti-Catholic bent, and conspiracy plots. Based on a perusal of the reviews here, many readers do take the writing as fact! On the one hand, it's laughable that Americans rely on novels and Hollywood movies for an understanding of history. On the other, it is very sad and consequently, Mr. Brown should be embarrassed to propagate so much falseness and bigotry. Most concerning, it mocks all that is revered by Christianity by cloaking inaccurate information as fact. Moreover, it defames and slanders real organizations such as Opus Dei and the Catholic Church by assigning them roles as participants in modern-day criminal and deviant acts. Apparently, it is permissible to write a Catholic-bashing book. In sharp constrast, look at the media frenzy that has arisen surrounding Mel Gibson's The Passion for even daring to depict Jews in a bad light. Would a publisher ever dream of printing such a book about Muslims or Jews?! No. But Catholicism is fair game. The novel itself is poorly written consisting of shallow character devlopment and poorly crafted suspense; it relies on silly riddles and cliff-hangers at the end of ridiculously short chapters to ensure the reader will continue reading (in a book that numbers roughly 450 pages, there are 105 chapters). Overall, I am disappointed that Mr. Brown is making a fortune off unwitting readers.
