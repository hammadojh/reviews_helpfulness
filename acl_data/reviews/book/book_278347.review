Summary: Historically Incorrect
     The book reads poorly, the author claims he has done his research when he hasn't. He endoirses Gnostic Gospels like Thomas to support the idea that Jesus was married when he wasn't, ignoring the fact that the Gospel of Thomas says women must become men to be saved. He claims the Pope shut down the Knights Templar and persecuted them in Rome, when the historical evidence in fact says that the Pope couldn't have persecuted them from Rome because he was in France at the time and the King of France Manipulated the Pope into supressing them. The Pope wasn't the bad guy, it was the king of France etc, etc, etc, etc......ad infinitum. It is another example of a bigot, who because his bigotry is socially acceptable to an athiestic society and media that like to distort the truth, gets a way with publishing bad literature and lying about his scholarship. If some of the evil Characters were Jewish instead of Catholic no one would think it was such a great book.
