Summary: Am I missing something?
     While this book is acclaimed as one of the best fantasy novels of all time. I find that the most weighing factor for this is age. Being published in the early 20's, it was certainly a groundbreaking book in its time. At this point, however, while the book is better then some of what is out there, it is given far to much esteem. I found the book, superfluously wordy. The resolution of the plot easy to foresee. And I had a hard time finishing it, I wasn't filled with wonder. Perhaps this is due to my reading a great deal of fantasy previous to reading the Hobbit. I feel the works of HG Wells and Jules Verne have weathered the ages much more effectively. So I would recommend the Hobbit to adolescents, people who are interested in getting into fantasy, and those who have a great deal of patience.
