Score: 1.0/5.0

Summary: Holds my attention
     I have never been so diasppointed with a book. Dan Brown basically takes a few religious theories (that have been around for quite a while and aren't obscure at all) and intertwines them with a lame plot. Don't waste your time reading this book. The fact that so many people like it and find it so earthshattering is only a sad testament to how pathetic, limited, and closed minded we have become.
