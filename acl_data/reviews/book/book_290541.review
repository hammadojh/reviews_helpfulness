Summary: Better than expected
     For those of you who love to bash the truth to serve your own delusion, wake up and smell reality - this is not a crock of crap - this is a great book and guess what? The history in this book can be independently verified by numerous sources, but obviously those sources are not the one's taught in your school - they are the sources of real research and discovery that no school would have the guts to teach because how could teachers explain that we have been shrouded from the truth for centuries and they have been willing participants in the lie because they are lazy. We have been lied to about religious &quot;fact&quot; to serve only the good of the &quot;church&quot;, to ensure that their power will not go away. To uncover the truth, writers and researchers like Dan Brown have to fly in the face of what we have been taught for centuries and begin to awaken our poor &quot;led by the nose&quot; population and take chances like this to print the truth. So for those of you, who are so ignorant and are professional &quot;followers&quot;, have fun in the god forsaken paper bag that you live in - because you'll never break out until you open your eyes.
