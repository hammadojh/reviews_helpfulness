Summary: the da vinci flop
     I didn't read &quot;The Da Vinci Code.&quot; I was about to when I read the FAQ on the book's website and was appalled by the shallowness of Dan Brown's answers. It was his answer to, &quot;HOW MUCH OF THIS NOVEL IS BASED ON FACT?,&quot; which really disappointed me. The bulk of his response was, &quot;The paintings, locations, historical documents, and organizations described in the novel all exist.&quot; Thriller or not, this book is passed off as being historically accurate and full of facts (which has been been commented on by numerous reviewers here and elsewhere). I expect a lot more information regarding his sources and research when he has unlimited space on the net (I didn't notice a bibliography in the back of the book either). I would probably enjoy this book as a mystery, but the way he presents this book seems devious and unethical which is why I chose not to read it.
