Summary: Much Ado about Nothing
     I finally broke down and read this book because of all the buzz it generated - after all, &quot;Cold Mountain&quot; generated a lot of buzz, and it was an excellent book. Unfortunately, this book reminded me of why I shy away from books on the best seller lists: They're usually pap. I think I'll go back to avoiding the best seller lists.
