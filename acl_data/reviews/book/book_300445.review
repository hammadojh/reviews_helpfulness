Score: 2.0/5.0

Summary: Original, delightful but not enduring literature
     Ugh. This was a recent selection in my book club, and apparently everyone else either liked or loved it. I thought it was mediocre at best. In spite of having such a fascinating premise, the execution is deeply disappointing. I felt like it had been written in a Writer's Workshop (or maybe just a fiction writing class at a community college). The symbolism was heavy handed (burning the ties that bind, broken glass/broken lives, etc.) and the writing was very uneven. Sometimes it was careful and well crafted, but more often it was overdone and occasionally it was flat and empty. I'm sure that the scene where she danced with her grandfather in heaven signified some terribly important transition for her, but by then I had stopped caring -- about her or her family, who were a bunch of enigmas. So, her mother is so emotionally fraught that she leaves the family (including her two remaining children) and as far as I can tell pretty much ceases contact with them. Maybe I could accept that. But then, (Spoiler here...skip to next paragraph if you don't want to know) eight years later she finds out her husband is ill, and comes rushing back to them. Sure, the son is sort of mad, but the rest of them embrace her as if she'd been on a long vacation. Would a real family do that? The best-drawn, most believable character in the whole book was the serial killer himself, but his ultimate demise is really kind of silly. Even the people who liked the book found the ending pretty awful. There are so many wonderful books out there. Skip this one and try something like Evening by Susan Minot instead. It's challenging, beautiful and haunting.
