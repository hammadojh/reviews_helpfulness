Score: 5.0/5.0

Summary: The Best One Yet!
     Outstanding book, ties together everything in books 1-5. Perfect storyline. Still a book for the whole family to read. Too bad there is only one more book in the series. I will hate to see Harry go. Thank you to Ms. Rowling, you are an outstanding author.
