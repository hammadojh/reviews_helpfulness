Score: 5.0/5.0

Summary: full of suspence
     The hobbit is full of adventure and excitement. At the beggining a lazy hobbit,Bilbo Baggins,is sitting at his porch. Then a wizard named Gandalf unexpectingly comes to his door. He asks Bilbo if he wants to go on an adventure. Bilbo refuses. But that doesn't last long. Soon enough Bilbo is with Gandalf and a group of 14 dwarves. He meets a giant, giant spiders, and a lake that makes them sleep. Soon after Bilbo meets Smaug, the evil dragon, for himself. I would highly recomend this book to people that like adventure books.
