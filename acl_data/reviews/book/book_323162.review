Score: 5.0/5.0

Summary: Much ado about nothing
     I can't imagine reading this book without these pictures. If you are not especially knowledgable about art or art history, this book makes a world of difference. Everything else about the book is the same as the standard version, so I will leave it to those reviews to rant and rave about what an awesome read this is.
