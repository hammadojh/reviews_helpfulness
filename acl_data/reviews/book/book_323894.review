Summary: The Holy Grail----the eternal McGuffin.
     I don't usually &quot;do&quot; fiction. But this book was amazing. The plot is allways expanding, the research is allways interesting, and the ending is superb. Now, i do take issue with some of it... Brown included a whole of real research in the novel, but it is mixed in with superstitious conspiracy theories and observations by main characters that look too deep into things. This could lead to a reader of the novel to blow up the signifigance of certain things. For those who will read the book, please remember this: Not many researchers beleive Mary Magdalene was married to Jesus, The man sitting next to Jesus in DaVinci's last supper doesn't look like a woman, and there is no evidence that the search for the Holy Grail was the search for the womb of Mary Magdalene, the bloodline of Jesus Christ. All in All, however, this is an amazing Novel and the only one I will probably ever read. It's back to non-fiction for me.
