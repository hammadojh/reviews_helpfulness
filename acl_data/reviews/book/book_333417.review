Score: 4.0/5.0

Summary: Great book, great philosophy
     Mostly I see this book as Objectivist propaganda dressed up in a romance novel, but that is kind of fun no. It arrived a bit earlier than simular utopian visions (in tactic rather than content) such as Celstine Prophecy and Boomeritis. Too bad the world isn't that simple. To bad Ayn isn't still around to witness the rise of the Internet and the raging post-post-modernism. The Fountainhead is fun too. Be careful if you are young and are getting swept up by ideas as you are seeking your self and a place in the world...this book might give you some lifting feelings that might lead you to accepting her ideas without much contrary thought. A striking book.
