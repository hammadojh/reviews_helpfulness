Summary: Ayn Rand's Messiah
     I thought this was an excellent novel. I do so little reading with a storyline. I usually read motivational material. What really hit me about this book though was how many things she wrote aboout the fall of capitalism that have happened already. That was the scary part. I dare any liberal or democrat to read this book and not end up taking a serious look at your positions.
