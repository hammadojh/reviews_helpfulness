Score: 1.0/5.0

Summary: not a great book
     After being forced to choke this down in High School 15 years ago, and hearing a contemporary who recently re-read it rave over it, I sat down to re-read the what everyone seems to call &quot;An American Classic&quot;. I didn't finish 100 pages. I fail to see what the fuss is about. I hated it in High School and couldn't finish it 14 years later. It's poorly written, dry, quite boring in its masturbatory ramblings, and lacks any sincere depth. Angst? No, its self-pity at its worst. The line between a cynical critique and mere whining is crossed so far that it is a point in your rear view mirror. How can you feel anything for this character?The scariest quality is that the whiny &quot;disenfranchised&quot; teens of today still identify with a character, who if he survived, would be their grandfather. I feel that this only perpetuates the cult of personal irresponsibilty that pervades America. The undercurrent that leads people to seek excuses for their actions, like &quot;I was abused&quot;, or &quot;I had post-partum depression.&quot;This is poorly written complaining. I agree with the teenager who whined for 200 words and asked for the Pulitzer.
