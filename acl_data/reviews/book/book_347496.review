Summary: One of the most profound works ever
     People who claim that Atlas Shrugged is promoting narcissism are missing the point of the novel. It isn't narcissistic to want happiness and personal well-being. It isn't narcissistic to develop a positive sense of self-worth and self-efficacy. It isn't narcissistic to have creative and productive pursuits in life. It isn't narcissistic to have personal integrity and principles to live by. The moral code of Atlas Shrugged is similar in some ways to the ~eudaimonia~ of Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics. Ayn Rand's accomplishment is that she presented a modern variant of eudaimonia.
