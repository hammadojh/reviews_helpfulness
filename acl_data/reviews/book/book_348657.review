Summary: Fiction That Became Fact
     I have heard of this book since I was in college, but am just now getting around to reading it. Even though this book is fictional and published in the 40's, it is an amazingly accurate portrayal of how socialism/progressivism affects society. It is a MUST read for EVERYONE! Be prepared to NOT be able to put down one of the longest books you will ever read.
