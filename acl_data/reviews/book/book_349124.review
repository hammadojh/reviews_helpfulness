Score: 3.0/5.0

Summary: BALANCE
     The book made it to me in good time, and looks great, except about 50 pages are bound in the book up-side down! The book was a gift for my husband and I was ready to return it, but he said he didn't mind just holding the book upside down for those 50 pages. Such a weird fluke!
