Score: 1.0/5.0

Summary: Hear me out...
     I was looking forward to getting this book because I had seen it a while back but could never find it and when I finally received this, I was upset. I was sent the 50th anniversary edition of The Hobbit not what I ordered. as well as it was an old library book. the checkout card was still inside and had the library stamp on all sides of the books sides. Just know that the book in the image is not the book you'll receive. This was a very disappointing purchase.
