Score: 1.0/5.0

Summary: What an amazing book.
     I saw a trailer for the movie coming out and decided to read the book. After the first few pages, I wondered if the whole book was going to consist of letters in a diary format to some unknown person. Well, that's exactly what it was. I agree with other reviewers that the main character in the book doesn't even write well, so it's somewhat frustrating to read. He writes as though he's much younger than his supposed age of 16. The content was actually offensive to me as well. There were too many references to physical and sexual abuse, masturbation, sex (heterosexual and homosexual), drug abuse (of all kinds), neglect, and there is a lot of foul language as well. Of course that stuff happens in real life, but there were very few parts in this book (if any) that made me happy to be alive. It was more depressing and discouraging than anything. I mean, it starts with a teenage suicide, and it hardly gets better after that. I like to read books for three reasons: to laugh, to learn something, or to be uplifted. This book didn't give me any of those. I returned it for a refund.
