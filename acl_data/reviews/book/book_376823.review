Summary: The first truly five star book
     This is a great book, if you can follow what's going on. I am a student who has read the book separetly from school, twice, and I am angry that other students have written inadequate reviews. The first time I read this, when I was eight, I was not following and comprehending what I was reading and would simply scan over all the pages, so of course it was boring, but I knew that I wasn't paying attention, so I didn't think badly of it unlike the other students who have taken the liberty of writing their opinions to Amazon. The second time I read it, I payed attention while I was reading and enjoyed the book. For those students which have disgraced The Hobbit's average rating, if they they didn't pay attention or missed a day in class, the book would be boring when it shouldn't. If you had to read The Hobbit for accademic purposes, please do not display your opinion as it has probably been damaged by the educational process.
