Score: 1.0/5.0

Summary: Slow
     How do the publishers or Amazon get away with this? While I love The Hobbit dearly, and consider LOTR to be my favourite book, the pricing of the Kindle edition is ridiculous. It is *more* than the price of the hardback! I was considering picking up an electronic copy of the book for moments when I just want to dip into this classic and I'm away from home, but I won't be taken for a ride like this.
