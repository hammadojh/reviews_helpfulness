Summary: The Giver
     Could you imagine living in a world that is always tring to be perfect. This book is called The Giver and it was written by Lois Lowery. The main characters of this novel are Jonas, Gabrial, Mom, Dad and the giver. The setting in this novel is in the community. The main conflict in the novel is that Jonas doesn't like that world cause it is so terrible. I think that the community is a dystopia because they try so hard to make it perfect but they make it a nightmare. I think that book is an ok book because it wasn't my type.- Duane Duncan
