Summary: A New Dickens
     In Holes, Sachar has created an initially dark tale with a taciturn protaganist who observes and becomes the unfolding of destiny, the unwinding of curse, the redemption that comes of unprejudiced love for your fellow human. It is many tales interwoven like the better Dickens, almost celtic in its interlacing of story-lines that as they converge across time create epiphanies for the reader, stairsteps of redemption. You will not find the sweet simple reversals of most young adult fiction, but a deep awareness that scars remain, that grudges can hold for generations, and that evil is only combatted by sticking close to your friends and your convictions. It is not luck or fate or fortune -- in spite of the curse which drives the story -- that produces the redemption, but instead the strength that Stanley gains through the trial, and his putting it to the use of saving a life. My son of 10 years has been asking me to read this book for six months or so. He said it was the best book he had ever read. I have always said yes someday, I am busy, etc. I have two degrees in literature and run a publishing company. I have little desire to read the typical young adult novel driven by bathroom lingo and who is popular and so forth. But recently he was sick and wanted me to lay down with him in the evening while he read so I reached over and picked up Holes. He was two hours sound asleep and I was still reading. This book holds well in my estimation with the great classics of destiny fulfilled: The Phantom Tollbooth, David Copperfield, Tristram Shandy, Esther, and Harold and the Purple Crayon.
