Score: 5.0/5.0

Summary: This book could have been written about the world today.
     Atlas shrugged is so profound that it is timeless. The characters and the beliefs that drive them can be applied to the world today with our current struggle between the looters and the producers. You will find yourself laughing out loud as you see similarities between the fictional looters of the book, and their flesh and blood incarnations that run many agencies and universities today. Not only is the book thought provoking, but it is beautifully written. Ayn Rand is so precise with her word usage that the book would suffer if any were changed. If you want a great story, powerful characters, and what has become a timeless theme, then Atlas Shrugged is for you. Those that hate this book probably see themselves or their ideas in it.
