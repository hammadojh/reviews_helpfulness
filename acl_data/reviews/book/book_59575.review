Score: 1.0/5.0

Summary: There wasn't an option for no stars.
     This inane and badly written book is like a broken record of a song you don't like to begin with. Aside from excruciating description of physical detail, this book is nothing but the repetition of a mantra--The good, strong, honest, industious, capable, intelligent people are forever plagued by the bad, weak, lying, lazy, incompetent, stupid people--how profound. Had this been an actual treatise, you would have found refutations of intelligent arguments, rather than the simplistic straw-man Ayn knocks down over and over and over and over....Had this been an actual novel, there would have been interesting characters. Can anyone who loved this book point out a significant difference in the characters of Wesley Mouch, Orren Boyle, Jim Taggart, Paul Larkin, Dr. Ferris, etc. ad nauseum?Of course, there are the &quot;romantic&quot; scenes! If you like to mix guilt, shame, and violence with your sex, then you'll love Dagny's relationship with Hank Rearden! Ugh!
