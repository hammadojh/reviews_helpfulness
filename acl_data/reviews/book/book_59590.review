Summary: Objectivism
     To begin with, I should say that I only read the first 200 or so pages of this book, before being forced to put it down. At the time, I had several friends who had taken up the objectivist philosophy, and I was very interested in it. While reading this book, I became so disgusted with the ideas behind it--as my personal philosophy differs so greatly--that I didn't bother to finish. That being said, this book is excellently well written, and is certainly Ayn Rand's magnum opus. It outlines her philosophical principles in a very literate, intelligent way, and is in it's own way, very gripping. If not for my own great philosophical differences, this book would earn five stars. It just can't be recommended to everyone.
