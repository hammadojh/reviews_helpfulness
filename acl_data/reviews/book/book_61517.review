Score: 5.0/5.0

Summary: A MUST read to understanding today's world
     This is the review I wrote about the original edition:"I have read this book over 10 times, and it is simply the best, most important book ever published! Whether you agree with her philosophy or not does not change the fact that she is mostly right! The story is engaging, and the philosophy she presents wants every reader striving for the best they can be! The moral chaos we live in today needs to be seriously examined, and Ayn Rand knows how to tell it as it is, and conceptualize complex issues into understandable alternatives. Highly recommended, if not for the philosophy, then for the storyline and the highest quality of writing."My opinion has not changed....
