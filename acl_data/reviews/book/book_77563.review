Summary: Unproveable smears and innuendo
     As a registered independant, I have problems with both parties. But this is such obvious smear campaign dirty politics type stuff. Purchasing this b will only lower the level of dirty politics in this country. If it keeps up, soon we will be like the Philippines or Argentina where everyone accuses everyone else of robbery,murder and revolution. Do your part to stop this escalating cycle of smear campaign tactics- ignore this nonsense...The text is mostly just innuendo, spins, etc. Even John McMain - a likely future Republican presidential candidate- was smeared in a very similiar way by Bush supporters during a past campaign and publicly accused Bush of being behind it at the time. The recently formed "swiftboat" organization's primary Kerry attacker was recently exposed as a complete b'ser. His medal citation for the SAME action also had MANY references to hostile fire! Yet he claimed Kerry's was untrue! How's that for hypocritical bs!
