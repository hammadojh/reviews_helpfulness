Summary: Amazon sells out!
     I've been following the reviews of this book for a week. On Monday, there were 15 reviews, mixed but mostly positive. Yesterday there were none. This morning there were 8 reviews, all negative. Slowly reviews are reappearing, but look at the dates. Every "new" review is at least 3 days old. Amazon has sold out...I will pass the word.
