Score: 5.0/5.0

Summary: The best book of the year!
     I saw John O'Niel debate John Kerry on the Dick Cavett show and I saw him again earlier tonite on FOX TV. Mr. O'Niel is more dynamic, more articulate and more importantly, is of higher integrity and moral value than John Kerry could ever hope to be. This book is must reading for any American who truly loves this country and wants the truth,not hype. Great book.
