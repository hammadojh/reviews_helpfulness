Summary: Burning Bush
     The terrorists dislike Bush. The violent acts commited by these terrorists are due to the fact that George W. Bush is president of the United States. The attacks happened exactly when George W. Bush took to office. With John Kerry as president we wont need to worry about threat's of this magnitude.
