Summary: Interesting little tale, but definitely more for children
     Although an oft amusing little tale (I especially liked the Gollum) and although I come to this book late, I have to say that I felt I was reading an Enid Blyton book most of the time, which is by no means a critism because she, above any other author fired my imagination as a child (which begs the question, why is this considered 'classic literature' and not 'The Enchanted Wood' or 'The Magic Far Away Tree')?I'm glad I've read it as it's much talked about, but it certainly wouldn't make me want to go on to read LOTR's. To be fair though I have to say I'm not usually attracted to the fantasy genre and read this because I felt I ought to. That said I thoroughly enjoyed all the Harry Potter books and Philip Pullmans 'Dark Materials' trilogy. I think maybe I just prefer a little human intervention to make things realistic now I'm an adult and parallel worlds are more interesting than gnomes, goblins and elves.
