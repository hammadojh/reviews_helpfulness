Summary: Something Wicked this Way Comes
     This book was good because it said something. It had a purpose. We may attach good or bad attributes to that purpose, but in the end it had a point. If something doesn't have a purpose then it is pointless and of no concequence. But, this book did have a purpose and therefore it was a good book. I would recommend it to anybody who seeks a purpose.
