Score: 2.0/5.0

Summary: Try "The Fountainhead" instead...
     ...it's shorter and reads better. I managed to get through about three quarters of this very long book, but it finally defeated me. Rand's ideas are worth understanding, but the speechifying finally wore me past patience and stamina. The "tragic" heroism of the main characters ceased being interesting pretty early in the book. If only Rand had cut this monster down by a third... the writing might have been tighter; the characters, limited in depth though they are, might have had more sharply drawn and entertaining trajectories; and the terribly dated "bogey and bacall" posing might have held me if only for historic and nostalgic reasons. I reached a point where I no longer cared how it all turned out. With no small sense of release I quit this volume for good and will not be back.
