Summary: If human nature didn't exist...
     For the idealistic narcissist. A story about a group of greedy narcissists that think they are indispensable. In a fictional world where capitalists actually care about making the best product--instead of the best profit, running away is supposed to make everyone realize those greedy capitalists were not so bad after all. Exposes the flaws in a certain strain of modern-day economic conservative mind-set. A bit of a strain to read, but not bad fiction.
