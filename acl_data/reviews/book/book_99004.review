Score: 1.0/5.0

Summary: I am shrugging, too.
     Maybe Rand had something interesting to say. Maybe not. Who can tell? Either way, her trademark novel is so stilted, so drawn out, so hypnotically boring, so irrepressibly repetitive, you'll never make it to the end, I promise. The most laughable part of this novel is her obsession with the Gold standard. Heck, what is gold but a highly conductive non-corroding metal? What is so magical about gold that it might somehow prevent the global economy from crashing and burning due to greed and stupidity? Why not use some other commodity upon which to base a currency? Why not use sand? Why not develop the Sand Standard whereby people deal in tons of sand instead of ounces of gold? Or why not use titanium, or bismuth or pork bellies or dung? This gold thing is just one example of Rand's supposedly ultra-rational view of reality (Objectivism) that turns out, when sufficiently examined, to be little more than some sort of fetish of hers, some kind of personal bias cloaked in a mange of so-called perfect reasoning. It's silly at its best, boring at its worst.
