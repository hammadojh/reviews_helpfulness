Summary: The BEST Vehicle GPS Navigator!!!
     The GPS is fine. It would have earned 5 stars execept the device that is supposed to keep it on the windshield is junk. It keeps falling off. We called Garmin and they sent a replacement. It worked for about a month and it too would not hold and fell off. After calling again they acknowledged that other users have had the same problem. They are now sending us a "bean bag" to sit on the dash. It is a shame that a low tech device is killing the overall performace of an otherwise great high tech item.
