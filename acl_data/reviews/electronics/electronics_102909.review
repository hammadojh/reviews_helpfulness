Score: 4.0/5.0

Summary: A reliable friend.
     We purchased this unit for visiting in Texas on about 6/1/06. It has the Version 8 maps with the matte screen. Overall, we're very satisfied but it's not perfect. We had to send the first sample we purchased back due to a dead pixel (I'm not shelling out $600 for a flawed product). The second model arrived flawless. Since then we've made the following observations. Pros- Talks to you with the street names, saving having to look at the screen as often. How much is your safety worth?- Attractive form factor, small enough but yet large enough- Good battery life- Saves gas and time, and reduces getting lost, even around your own town.- Display, we are pleased with the daylight and nightime performance. Cons:- Seems pricy for what you get- Startup time (acquiring satelites) seems excessive on a fresh power up.- Dozens of roads in the internal map software were not accurate causing much confusion when driving. This is a software map issue, not a hardware issue. Maps were not accurate.
