Score: 3.0/5.0

Summary: Definite bang for the buck, but a little loud for me
     I spent hours and hours debating whether to buy the 1.8 or the 1.4 50mm prime. In the end, my pocketbook won over and I opted for the 1.8. As others have said, it is definitely a GREAT VALUE with excellent (as far as my amateur eyes can tell) image quality. That said, I am returning this lens basically just because it is loud. For most intents and purposes, it's probably not that big of a deal, but I bought the lens hoping I could take some nice pictures at a friend's indoor wedding, and just think the noise made from focusing will be unacceptable in a quiet church. $250 *is* a lot of extra dough to drop on the 1.4 just because of the noise, but I'm hopeful some of the other qualities of the lens will make it worthwhile as well.
