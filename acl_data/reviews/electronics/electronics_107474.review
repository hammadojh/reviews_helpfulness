Score: 1.0/5.0

Summary: Finally a better alternative to an iPod!
     Sorry the Zune player and Zune Marketplace fall far below expectations. Clunky, bulky player, awkward marketplace with deceptive pricing and misleading inventory. On-PC jukebox has installation problems. Looks like the "total experience" imitating Apple was hastily thrown together, in the hopes that the Windows world would step up and select the Microsoft underdog. Not this design iteration, nor probably ever.
