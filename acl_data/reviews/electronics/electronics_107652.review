Summary: Zune 30GB Digital Media Player
     I recently purchased the ZUNE and was excited to come home and get it going. I put the disc in and started to install the software. When it asked me to plug in the ZUNE i did so and my computer froze completly. After restarting i finish installing the software (took FOREVER to complete) The media player was a nightmare. Slow choppy movement and constantly freezing for a few seconds. Not my computers fault (if thats what your thinking) it is just poor software. Well i realise that everytime i plug my zune into the computer, it locks the computer up. I tried getting online to check the zune HELP section and wait a minute...somehow ZUNE deleted my ethernet driver! ?! ?! It took 3 days and many hours on the phone and live tech chat to get my computer back to working properly. Needless to say i uninstalled ALL zune software and exchanged my zune for an ipod.
