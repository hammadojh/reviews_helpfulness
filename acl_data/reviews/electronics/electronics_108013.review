Score: 5.0/5.0

Summary: [...] : Target : : iPod : Zune
     This is an excellent player. Besides a robust marketplace software, that let you easily browse your own selection, I think he subscription concept is a fantastic. You just go there download whatever you like and listen, that simple. Besides, if there is something you really like, then just flag it and then you can come back to the marketplace and downright buy it. The player is a little bit on the big side for my taste, but the functionality is so rich that it is worth it evey ounce! On the downside: the earphones are not that good. I plugged it a seinheiser set I own and the sound rocks!
