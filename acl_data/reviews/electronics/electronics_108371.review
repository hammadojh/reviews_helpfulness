Score: 5.0/5.0

Summary: Designed to hoodwink consumers
     nice gadget that brings better value, bigger screen, more durable case and good interface compared to the ipod. no reason to switch from ipod if you have it, but if you're looking for a player for the first time, take a look at this one. it also integrates w/windows better too, especially if you have a bunch of songs that you ripped from cd.
