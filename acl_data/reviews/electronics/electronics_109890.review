OK, second to last. There was a $35 Logitech system that WAS admittedly much worst. But other than that, the other systems, ranging from fifty to a hundred fifty dollars more or less, were equal or far better. The Bose Companion 3 system suffers from the same problem as every other Bose product: all the money and thought has gone into a sleek compact form factor and an ingenious saturation-advertising campaign. So what you hear is music that's so deeply unnatural-sounding, with muted highs and muddy smeary mid-bass, which is mainly impressive to someone who's had experience only with bargain basement Walmart generic brands. The satellites are cute as all get-out, but they leave out a huge amount of detail in the music, plus can't go very loud so if you crank the volume it's mostly subwoofer that you hear...and not a terribly good subwoofer at that. The Klipsch ProMedia 2.1 system which goes for a hundred less simply destroys this system without breaking a sweat. If Bose sold this system for say fifty bucks instead of two hundred fifty it might be much less of a rip-off.
