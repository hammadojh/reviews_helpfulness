Score: 4.0/5.0

Summary: don't buy for recording
     This 2.1 system sounds good compared to other powered PC speakers and can be considered a notch or two above the rest. I compared them to several offerings from Logitech and Creative (both 2.1 and 5.1 systems). I offer this opinion based on the fact that they were as neutral sounding as I could find. My biggest problem with ALL of these powered speaker systems is with the mids. Mids eat it big time on each system I tried and these Klipsch's are no exception. But, they were the best sounding of any that I tried. So the bottom line is: These are the best available if you're going to go with powered PC speakers. On the other hand, getting one of those inexpensive receivers with some cheap speakers would probably yield better sound. Reality check: I don't expect PC speakers to blow me away, but I need a minimum level of sound to enjoy the experience. FYI, my reference system consists of: PSB Stratus gold x4 plus Stratus center, Anthem 5 channel, Sony E9000es pre-amp. Overall Pros:- Better, more neutral sound when compared to other similar systems- Little distortion- Bass sounds good with sub on a low settingOverall Cons:- Mids are weak (but better than others)- Highs can be a bit shrill at higher volumes- No power switch on control module
