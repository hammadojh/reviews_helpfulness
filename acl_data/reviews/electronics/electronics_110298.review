Score: 3.0/5.0

Summary: Vastly overrated
     These sound incredible. I have had my set for 2 years. Today the amp died. A check of many online forums indicates this is nothing new. In fact, many people experience the same problem at right around the 2-year mark. So, if you want to spend close to $400 for speakers that sound wonderful for about 2 years, you can't beat Klipsch. I however will be giving some Logitech Z-5500s a try...
