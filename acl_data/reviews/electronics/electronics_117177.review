Score: 1.0/5.0

Summary: Works great, once you've figured out setup
     Linksys wants you to think all of the glowing BEFW11S4 reviews are talking about the same hardware. Unfortunately the quality in the current iteration of this router (Version 4) makes me worried about Linksys's future. Several years ago I bought version 2 of this router and was very happy with it. I also had a friend with version 1 that had worked well for him. So when I needed another one for myself I figured Linksys would be a good bet. I could not have been more wrong. Version 4 (If there is only one row of lights on the front it's after version 2) is the worst network hardware I have ever used. Out of the box it is obvious that this is not the same hardware as the previous versions and it becomes much more apparent when you actually try to use the thing. I never saw the router work for more than 30 minutes without hanging and forcing me to physically un-plug and plug in the router to get it to respond. From reading about other people's experiences it seems that this is a hardware defect or a firmware defect that has not been fixed in multiple releases over the last year. In fact new firmwares have actually introduced new problems so this router is just not worth the trouble. If you know you are getting a version 3 or earlier go for it, otherwise don't waste your time or your money.
