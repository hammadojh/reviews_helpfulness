Score: 3.0/5.0

Summary: good deal
     I bought this kit about 16 months ago, and while the quality of each component is clearly low-tier, I have used all three pieces without issue...until recently. My wife used the travel adapter on her iPod nano (5th gen.) and found the nano was completely dead after charging it for several hours. The nano will no longer start or mount in iTunes and my wife is using her Apple Care warranty to get it serviced. I tried charging my iPod Classic with the travel adapter for an hour. I noticed the adapter seemed warmer than usual, and Instead of charging the battery, according to the Classic's battery status meter, the battery had actually been drained. I had begun charging with about a 20% charge, and upon checking, found I had essentially no charge. The info I found online is of 2 schools:A. Don't mess with cheap power adapters as they can damage your iPod's batteryB. Don't worry -- your iPod has overcharge protection built inApple itself says that only its proprietary (and overpriced) USB power should be used. The tech at Apple made an interesting comment to my wife saying she should limit the time she leaves her nano plugged in to any USB power source to 4 hours or less to avoid overcharging. I could find nothing online to support this advice and am not clear if it s model-specific to her nano. Since I'm unwilling to risk any more iPods to further testing of the adapter, we're not going to use it any more.
