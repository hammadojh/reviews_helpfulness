Score: 1.0/5.0

Summary: GOOD PRICE, BUT NOTHING STANDS BEHIND IT.
     If you have an existing LAN, this &quot;router&quot; will NOT work. Linksys'idea of a LAN is a bunch of computers with network cards. If you have an existing LAN with IPs for each machine you might as well throw all IPs away except one. The support was terrible. It took me over the &quot;return time&quot; to finally figure out it wouldn't work for my LAN. The support staff are rude and only knowlegeable about how they want you to set it up.
