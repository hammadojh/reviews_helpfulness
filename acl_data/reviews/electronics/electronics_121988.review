Summary: I hope you don't want to add media
     I got this for my daughter after a few problems with an IPOD that she had for two years. Well, the Zen here worked for about 10 minutes and we're two days and waiting for customer support at Creative. When she received it for Christmas, she told me that it didn't work. Thinking that she didn't have it set up correctly, I finally had some time to work with it this past weekend (April). Well, she was right, it doesn't work. Loaded everything, got it in sync and then it promptly froze in recovery mode with the computer software saying that it isn't plugged in since it's in recovery mode. Catch 22! Find another brand, it can't be any worse.
