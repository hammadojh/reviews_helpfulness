Summary: Great keyboard
     I had the very first model of the MS ergonomic keyboard, but last month one of my hefty certification books fell on it from a high shelf, crushing the poor, overworked keyboard. I had a lot of good memories with that old keyboard. I've been typing on it longer than I've known my wife. I went and searched and saw Microsoft just came out with this new model of this great keyboard. I got it right when it came out and have been using it for about a month now. I love this keyboard. It's great for those who type for long periods of time and need to save their wrists. I actually use the extra keys as well, even the calculator button. The arrow keys are larger than my old MS keyboard. I also like that the keyboard is black, as my monitor is black, my pc is silver and black, and I just got the new Logitech MX1000 mouse that matches it perfectly. I highly recommend this keyboard, and even if the cost is higher than other keyboards, it is well worth it considering the advantages.
