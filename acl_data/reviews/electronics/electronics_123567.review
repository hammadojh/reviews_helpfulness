Summary: Garmin maps have some major problems
     UPDATE: Have owned for nearly 4 months. Just updated the maps to v.8. This unit is great. BIG BENEFIT OF GPS (I'M ATTEMPTING TO BE A "VISIONARY" HERE) is that more than helping you FIND, it helps you stay "unlost." It makes you more willing to travel off the beaten path, because you're not afraid of getting lost. I wonder if this will reverse the demise of local sights/stops/shops brought about by interstate highways over the years.------------Bought a "reconditioned" unit at Bass Pro Shops...they say it's a brand new overstock from another retailer, and therefore can't be sold as "new." $100 less than a truly "new" unit, so I bought it. Took it home, downloaded the software updates via Garmin's "web updater" tool, programmed in "favorite" addresses for an imminent weekend trip, and attached to windshield to L of rear-view mirror, at top of windshield so as not to block view. Outstanding. Satellite acquisition time is good, the unit is extraordinarily easy to use, and it doesn't distract with non-GPS bells and whistles, such as MP3, traffic (I have that on my XM Radio), etc. It's a basic GPS, ridiculously simple to use, with a good screen (size and image quality) and good touch sensitivity. While it doesn't verbalize street names ("turn right" is what it says), the street names are displayed in a bar at top of screen; for the difference in price between this unit and the 340, this unit is a steal, unless you need the traffic capability. VERY tempted to pick up a second unit for my wife's car.
