Summary: Harmony 880 is what I needed!
     This is the remote control that ruined Christmas. Unless all your home theater equipment is relatively new, I'd advise against trying this product. Total time for three people (all of whom work in IT) attempting to program the remote to control a new TV and six legacy home theater systems = 15 hours. Sample dialog:Mother (after 4 hours programming): I still can't get it to turn on the transceiverDaughter: Maybe you should just return itFather: The guy at [large electronics store] said it was easy to set upMother (after 6 hrs): Everything is working except the DVD playerDaughter: The surround sound is not working either. Maybe you should just return it. Father: The [large electronics store] says they'll come program it for $150Mother: I'm not paying $150 for someone to program a remote controlTWO WEEKS LATERDaughter-in-law: I'll program it. (after 3 hrs) The transceiver won't turn off and the DVD player doesn't work. Daughter: I told you you should have just returned it. Mother: It's too late to return it. Why does it have three profiles now?Daughter-in law: (after 2 hours) I've found a way to delete the old profiles, but it won't turn the TV on now. I'll write you instructions for how to use the four old remotes. Note, most of this dialog repeats...over and over.
