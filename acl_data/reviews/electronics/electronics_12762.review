Score: 5.0/5.0

Summary: Works great, good range
     This product was well designed. The unit charges one battery while the other is inside the transmitter in the remote. When the charge runs out, swap them; very convenient! I get good range, about 30 feet through floors and a brick wall. Perfect unit if you have TVs in different locations playing from the same source.
