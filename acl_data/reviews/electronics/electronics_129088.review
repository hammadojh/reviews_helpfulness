Summary: That's Hot!!!!!!
     Maybe I have a lemon, but I find the volume control on this unit to be absolutely aatrocious. Sound...fine, video...fine, actually, everything is fine EXCEPT the volume control. I have had the unit about 8 months now and had I known how difficult it is to control the volume, I would NEVER have bought this unit. It seems remarkably stupid to make what is primarily an audio device and put such poor volume controls on it. But maybe you won't find it as irritating as I do.
