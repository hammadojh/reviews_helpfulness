Score: 1.0/5.0

Summary: BAD Support
     The Zune's amd Zen's these days look offly close to IPOD's but lack the durability/battery life/features/fuctionailty and performance of Apple's players. This vision just looks like a twisted version of an IPOD classic, but don't be fooled it's not it's just a cheap rip off. I tried zunes and Zens before getting my IPOD classic and I will never go back, plud my IPOD lasted 3 times as long as a zune or zen and is still going perfectly. The Zen Vision died in about 6 months from light use and the track pad on these devices is terrible. The hard drives in these things need to be formatted and freeze every other day, and if you fill the hard drive even remotly close to max the Zen is very, very sluggish. Do yourself a favour with no headaches and enjoy your music not spend all your time trying to get it to work....get an IPOD. Zen or Zune cannot compare to coverflow and improved sound alone on the new IPOD classics/Touch's.
