Summary: A great invention, that actually works!
     Length:: 3:16 MinsNext Generation Remote Control ExtenderI had a need to remote control my TiVo HD and DVD player that are located inside a closed cabinet. I tried to use an inexpensive RF remote control but I hated the remote and there is a significant amount of lag when I push the button on the remote. Sometimes the component didn't register the command at all. Very frustrating. I did a little more research on how to control my components that were hidden inside this cabinet and I ran across this Next Generation Remote Control Extender. At first I thought this was the same thing as those stupid X-10 Pyramid remote extenders or IR repeaters, but as I read more about it I realized this was something different. In short, this system will allow you to convert your standard remote into a powerful RF remote. This is a very unique solution. I used this system to convert my favorite Logitech/Harmony 676 universal remote into a RF remote that can control my TiVo HD and DVD player while hidden out of sight in my cabinet. It totally works and there no lag from when I push a button to the action on the screen. Love it!
