Score: 4.0/5.0

Summary: Not worthy of the Apple or iPod name
     I love my iPod, but I also understand it's not going to be for everyone. My primary reason for purchasing this product was to store lots of movies and music for travel. If you don't mind the tiny screen, it's great for a personalized flick on the airplane. And my entire music collection fits on the hard drive with a lifetime's growth that could still be added. I've noticed people complaining about crashes, rebooting and the redesigned thumbwheel. I have no issues with these items. I have no issues with the music quality. I do not like DRM or the fact that this iPod requires a special $50 cable to activate TV out features. That's a load, but it wasn't a deal breaker for me since I don't really plan on using mine for watching movies on a larger screen. For a man who can remember paying $400 for 4MB of RAM about a decade ago, I feel like I got a decent deal. I'm a fairly satisfied iPod owner. This iPod will scratch up immediately. It does not come with a protective shell of any kind. I got mine laser etched with "ad vitam paramus" and I like scratches - they add personality like scars do. Several other notes - at the time of this review many of the old accessories for iPods are NOT COMPATIBLE with the "Classic" - it's particularly important to note that your old docking station isn't going to work with this new iPod. The included headphones for the black model are white. If that's the sort of thing that bothers you, be prepared. I don't use these included headphones because I think they are crappy. I upgraded to black Shure e2c headphones.
