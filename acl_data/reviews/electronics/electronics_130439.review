Summary: Ease of use has never been better
     Well, I was waiting for a long time for Apple to design a product with enough storage space for my entire music collection. This is my first Ipod and third MP3 player. I'm very happy with the storage capacity because I could load all my music plus all my data, using the "Use as hard drive" feature. I already said it's my first Ipod, so I wasn't used to the operating system and commands. About it I can say it's very easy to use and I learned it quickly. The only downside to this equipment is that, now that all my music is loaded, sometimes it's a little difficult to find a specific song. I have to say that I haven't finished updating all the tags of my music collection (Title, Artist, Genre, etc.), so this can be contributing a little to the search process, but even if I had all my collection updated, the clickwheel by itself isn't handy enough to help me find a specific song. I think Apple should think about updating the clickwheel with a different tool to navigate. Some people may say, the Ipod touch has the solution..., but it doesn't have enough storage to me. So, summarizing, I'm happy with my Ipod.
