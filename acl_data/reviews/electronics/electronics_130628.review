Score: 4.0/5.0

Summary: IPOD
     This is somewhat of what i was expecting. I got this because it was popular and everyone had one and it is has many acessories you can get for it. Its a nice gadget, but there are many cons to it. It scratches way to easily, it dosent come with a good useable case, charging it sucks because your computer has to be on.. moniter and everything unless you BUY the outlet charger. Also, the battery dosent last that long like for a road trip, and the ipod isint compatable with any movies or video except the ones you buy from their music store or you can buy a converter. Overall, this ipod has been costing me alot of money and i would say just get an mp3 player that plays videos instead unless you just want to fit in with the crowd.
