Summary: Don't Buy It - Ver 5 is Broken
     lightning killed my old v2, which worked flawlessly. I replaced it last week with the new v5. Works fine, as long as you don't mind resetting it on a daily basis. For whatever reason it just hangs every 8 or 10 hours or so. Upgrading firmware to 1.00.2 does not fix things. v5 also has half the memory of previous versions. In short, my experience with the WRT54G v5 has been negative.
