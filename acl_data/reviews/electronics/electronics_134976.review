Score: 1.0/5.0

Summary: Just didn't work.
     This router is terrible. It comes with little to no instructions on how to actually use it. I spent 5+ hours trying to set it up, with no success, so I finally called their tech support. Their tech support is even worse than the actual product itself. Over the course of two weeks, I called 5 times, and everytime, they offered no actual help, but instead directed my to the same page ofn their website, even after I told them that I had already gone to that page, and was still having the same problem. Eventually, I managed to get it working, but I'm still having problems. When I boot up my computer, it only connects about 70% of the time. The other 30% of the time, I have to re-boot. Even if it does work, I'm lucky if it remains consistent for more than 10 minutes. It's constant disconnecting makes it very hard to do anything on the internet. Don't make my mistake. If you need a wireless router, go with D-Link or Belkin instead. Anything but Linksys.
