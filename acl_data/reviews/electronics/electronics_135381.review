Summary: Linksys WRT54G Wireless-G Router
     I ordered this hoping all the rave reviews would be my experience vs. the really negative reviews. I was wrong. I believe this little device could do all it claims if it can ever be configured properly. User documentation is a joke and LinkSys HelpLESS desk is not much better. Was attempting to connect this router to my ISP's router which some reviewers had success in doing with cross over cables and static ip's. Unfortunately I wasn't one of them. 3 days lost messing with this and Linksys tech support was really weak. I knew more than they did about their product. To quote one 'tech' &quot;I'm confused&quot;...duh! I'm convinced all the calls went to some outsourcer in India to boot so getting through was an ordeal in itself. If you have a very simple setup and don't care too much about security you may be very happy with this. I can only reason that all the rave reviews by first time non-tekkie users is based on not needing alot of functionality and using device defaults. But if you need anything more YOU need to know what you are doing because help is non-existant. I'm sure this could be a great addition to a home network but it will take someone savvier than me to get it to work. Good luck if you decide to go ahead with this product!
