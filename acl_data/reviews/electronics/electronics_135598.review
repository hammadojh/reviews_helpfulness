Score: 1.0/5.0

Summary: Excellent...No Problems
     I bought this product along with a corresponding PC Card (both LinkSys). Since LinkSys is owned by Cisco, I figured I couldn't go wrong. The rebate made it even more attractive. I got the router set up in 10 minutes, and was surfing fine from my desktop (which was wired to the router). I had good speed and no real problems when using my desktop. The wireless aspect, however, was not so good. The setup for a wireless connection was routine. The instructions were good and I was able to 'see' the access point almost right away. The trouble I had was maintaining a connection. I was consistently connecting at maximum 'g' speed, but the connection would drop every five minutes (almost to the second). Right in the middle of surfing, I would lose the connection and have to sign-in again. Over the course of an hour, it happened 12 times. So, I went through the setup process again to see if I missed anything. The next hour, it happened 12 times again. Range and speed worked as advertised. It just only works for five minutes at a time. As I've been looking around the Internet to see if other people are experiencing similar things, it seems I am not alone.
