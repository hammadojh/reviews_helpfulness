Summary: Koss Portable Stereo Headphones - LOVE THEM!
     These are the best! Nothing falling out of my ear like the stupid earbuds, and nothing to mash down my hair. The speakers connect around your ear keeping them in place. The thin connective wire does without the plastic band that mashes down your hair. The sound of the headphones is great too. I bought two pair and use the second pair on my computer at work to listen to music so to not disturb co-workers and I get the same great sound. I recommend these to everyone.
