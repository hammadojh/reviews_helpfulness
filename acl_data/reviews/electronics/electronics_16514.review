Summary: very good product
     The two gb Nano is a very good product. It has many features such as an alarm clock, games, and calender. The Nano itself is very easy to use and being a first mp3 owner I really like the portability and wide range of music avalable. The space on my Ipod filled up suprisingly fast so if your music library is large you may want to go with a model with more capacity. You have to download Itunes from the Apple website and it took me several tries on my home PC. The Ipod is geared mostly towerds Mac users so if you have a PC than you will have a little bit of a harder time getting your Ipod going. The only thing I don't like about the Nano is the fact that Apple moved the head phone jack and made the Nano slightly longer than the first generation Nano. These changes made getting a case and other acsessories a lot harder than it should have been. Overall the Nano is a very good product and it is compleatly worth the money.
