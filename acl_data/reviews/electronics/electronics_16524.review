Score: 5.0/5.0

Summary: This is the best
     Simply said, I love this Nano. It is light-weight, easy to use, not bulky, the sound quality is excellent (especially after I got rid of the ear-buds that came with it - too big for my ears - and got a decent pair of earphones), and the color isn't white. That said, I quickly realized that 500 songs were too few and have recently upgraded to the new iPod video. But there are times when I really miss my Nano. A couple of years ago, I unfortunately bought a second iPod (the Nano was my third) that was a lemon from the getgo. It wouldn't hold a charge, and my local Apple dealer said, too bad. I had sold my first iPod when I got the second, larger iPod/lemon. I still have it in its original box. But I missed my music and I missed my iPod. So when Apple came out with the Nano, it was love at first sight, and I decided to try again. This Nano holds its charge without a problem. For the beginner iPodder, the Nano is the perfect choice.
