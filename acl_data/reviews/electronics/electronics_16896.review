Score: 4.0/5.0

Summary: Dumped 4GB nano for this
     I was impressed with the 1st generation nano 4gb. However 4gb is too small to hold all my legally purchased songs as I use 320kbps in encoding. Therefore I took the 2G nano 8gb. Here are my 2 cent:The Good:- The finish now resists some scratches, which is what we are looking for- Probably the best quality 8gb player on the market at this price range. Big bang for your money.- It seems more responsive than the previous nano.- It supports song searching now. The Bad:- Personally I perfer the silver color, but the black color is the only option for 8gb.- The packaging looks like a cheaper product than the 1st nano; in fact $249 for a mp3 is not cheap at all- I don't know if the sound quality has been improved or degraded using my Shure earphone. But at least I can recognize the default "EQ off" has been tweaked, which I need some time to get used to.- The LCD display is brighter, but the contrast does not look better than 1st nano.- I can't get iTune 7.0.0 working on my PC. It seems like Apple was forced to release it the same day Steve speaks. It is a big disappointment. Finally 7.0.1 came to fix my problem.- It does not fit to 1st generation Nano Dock. It is an unexpected big disappointment. I really don't understand why Apple can't make it compatible with the former dock, as the connector is just shifted to the edge a mm! The 2nd nano deserves a 4-stars, as it does not beat the 1st nano. Anyway it is a hard competitor for Zune to beat.
