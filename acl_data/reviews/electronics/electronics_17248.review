Summary: Ok does it really meet the ipod mini?
     a lot of people in the reviews were comparing this with the ipod mini. im sorry you cant compare the 2 i dont have this ipod and i dont want it because frankly these things are getting to be out of control. the ipod mini was the perfect size even though they are thicker than the nano you would know it is there and you wouldnt break it by accident( a lot of people i know did)and also i hear about the other ipod nanos that they stop working after a while. and making these things even thinner was stupid considering that the other ipod nanos were too thin in the first place. Why couldnt they just make a ipod mini with a color screen?
