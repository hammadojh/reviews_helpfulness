Summary: Causes lens flare
     I bought this to protect my Sigma 30mm f1.4, but after using it for a few days and noticing a high level of flaring, I tested it by taking identical shots with and without the filter. Low and behold, the filter was the cause of most of the flaring. Spend some more on a coated filter.
