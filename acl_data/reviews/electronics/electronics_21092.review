Score: 2.0/5.0

Summary: Receiver problems
     Many aspects of the unit seemed good but I returned the one I ordered because in some locations in my apartment the radio received some type of commercial radio or TV signal. The audio coming from the radio was clearly not from a weather radio station. My older Radio Shack weather radio does not have this problem.
