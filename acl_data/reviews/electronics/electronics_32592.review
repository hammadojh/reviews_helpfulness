Score: 4.0/5.0

Summary: Perfect for Micro 4/3 cameras like the Olympus E-P1
     This is one of those "must gets" if you cherish your Micro 4/3 lens. Sadly, on the Olympus E-P1 it sticks out a bit, not really annoying, but since the 14-42mm lens on the E-P1 retracts so nicely, you'll immediately notice that the lens isn't as compact as it used to be. Still, better to have a small filter sticking out than damage your $300 lens. Quality of the filter is fine, but then again, there isn't much you can mess up on a UV filter.
