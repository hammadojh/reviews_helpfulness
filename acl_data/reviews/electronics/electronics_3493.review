Score: 1.0/5.0

Summary: Don't waste your money
     Absolute waste of money. Uncomfortable, with the worst sound of any earphone/headphone that I've ever used. I tried every eartip with no success. Manufacturer ignored my email. Stick with the Apple iPod earbuds or buy something cheap from a local store.
