Score: 3.0/5.0

Summary: they are okay
     these are okay. they have a very good treble. but no bass. i cant believe how low the bass is on these headphones. the noise cancelling raises the rating but these wouldve been a 2 star for the lack of bass. if your buying for noise cancelling these are good but for sound these are awful ive seen headphones for twenty that have better sound.
