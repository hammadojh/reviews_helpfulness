Score: 4.0/5.0

Summary: Well
     Before buying these I read a lot of hype here on amazon and expected some darn good headphones which would replace my Sony fotopia earbuds. I was wrong. I guess earbuds create a lot more substance to sound. Compared to them, the PX100 shound shallow and are not punchy enough. The bass is better though. These are advertised as headphones you can use in planes, and in other places with people. Well, you COULD, if you listened to the music at really low volume so you wouldn't be an annoyance to anyone. At 70% volume on my Creative Zen, these cans sound almost like speaks, 100%, they definitely sounds like speakers. Sound insolation is bad in other words and you're gonna get a lot of bad looks (especially if you are in a library or something). In any case, I like how sturdy they are, and the sound is superior to any cans that I've had before, so that's good. Great bass. I listen to a lot of heavy music and these serve pretty good job. Someone said they feel like "any $5 set on your head." To this person, I can tell that he's never used a $5 headset. The PX100 feel nice and comfortable, like a $30 headset. I hope the wire holds. If you are looking for a lot of richness in your music, go with earbuds (any $40+ set). I like the PX cause they are not as fragile, and I have a problem with fragility.
