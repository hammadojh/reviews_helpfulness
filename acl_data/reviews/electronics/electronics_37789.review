Score: 5.0/5.0

Summary: The best bang for the buck in a charger.
     I received an updated charger as well as the updated replacement power supply due to the recall. It looks as if this has solved all of the problems. I have been using this charger for some time now with no problems. No more heat issues and battery charging is quick and accurate. I can now recommend this charger with no problem. I use this charger several times a week and much prefer it over the standard wall type chargers. I primarily us Enelope batteries with this charger.
