Summary: I like the noise it makes
     I like the noise the Presto makes; if it didn't make noise, I might forget about it. I start it on a high setting (7) and lower it to 4 when it starts to make noise. Then I time it for whatever I am cooking. Mostly I use stainless steel bowls like a double boiler, perfect rice every time, and the bowls are easier to clean than the cooker itself. The recipe book says not to cook split peas but if you rinse them well and put two tablespoonfuls of cooking oil on top, they cook just fine, I never see any signs of frothing on the inside of the top after cooking. 8 minutes and they are done, much, much longer with a conventional pan. I think my digestion has improved since I started using the pressure cooker.
