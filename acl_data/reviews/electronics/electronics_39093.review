Score: 4.0/5.0

Summary: Works Well
     Pretty good in quality and easy to use. I used pressure cookers before many years ago. This stainless steel one offers the convenience and time-saving in cooking, especially in cooking those foods that take a long time to cook. The size fits the needs of small to median families well. Personally, I would like it to be a little larger in diameter and shorter in height.
