Summary: True Company Service at a Great Price
     It is rare, in this day and age, that a company does exactly what is asked of them. It seems that when they money is paid all "Service" goes out the window. Quality Photo not only met my expectations, BUT, exceeded them. The product was exactly as advertised, in great shape, with all accessories and manuals. I ordered the product on Monday and the product was in my hands on Wednesday. Thanks for great "Service", a great product and the prompt shipping. Scott A. Young
