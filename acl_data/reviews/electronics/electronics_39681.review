Summary: Canon Speedlite 430EX II
     I purchased this flash to go with my digital EOS Rebel. I am unsure if I need to learn more about it but I don't know if it does what it is intended to do, illuminate a room. In dimly lit areas it doesn't do as well as I hoped. Photoshop does wonders. Maybe as I continue to use it I will get better but at this time I'm not super thrilled with it, considering the cost.
