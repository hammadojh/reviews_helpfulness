Summary: gross earwax on "new" earphones
     After spedning a lot of time researching some new earphones, I settled on this pair. Opening the box the contents looked immediately used. Then the actual earphones as well as the foam covers both were covered in orange earwax. UNBELIEVEABLE! Talk about gross... I showed my wife and we could honestly not believe that we received these in teh mail form a supossedly reputatble retailer. nasty. immediatlety returned and I will buy these form a brock & mortar reltailer now.
