Summary: Disposable Earbuds - Don't Bother
     The sound quality is good, the external noise blocking is good, fit is decent, but durability is non-existent. After using these all of about 15 times or so, I noticed the sound had become muffled and weak in one of the earbuds. I sent them back to Sennheiser and they sent me a brand new pair under warranty no questions asked (thumbs up on their customer service). I took extra care with the replacement and handled them as delicately as possible, taking care to never pull on the wires, or bang them around or subject them to any other abuse. However, after a month of so of use, same problem as the first pair. Sound is dead in one earbud and muffled in the other. Stay away from these headphones. They sound good at first, but fall apart fairly quickly even when treated gingerly. This is a disposable product.
