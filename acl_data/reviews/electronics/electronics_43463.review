Score: 3.0/5.0

Summary: If looks matter...
     The review of almost every other headphone on this site points you to these as better sounding for a lower price. What they don't bother to mention is that they make you look completely ridiculous. Oh sure, the sound is outstanding - particularly for the price - but they are HUGE, and have a big ol' curly cord that bounces all over the place. If your plans for your headphones include sitting in your mom's basement, listening to Rush, and lecturing your cat about how Fly By Night changed your life then these are for you. If, on the other hand, you plan on venturing out into the world, look elsewhere. I'm even embarrassed wearing these around the house.
