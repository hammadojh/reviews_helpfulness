Summary: Shady product, shady people
     I really liked these earbuds when I first got them. But only after a few months, they stopped working. So I replaced them under the warranty, but sure enough, it happened again! So I replaced them again under the warranty. Quite a pain in the ass, but I thought I'd take extra good care of them to make sure nothing happened. So I started to protect them better. But once again, they broke down. I wasn't sure if they were under warranty as I was out of the country for a while when they shipped and didn't get to use them for a long time. I was told that replacement warranty lasts 6 months as opposed to usual 12, so I was not under warranty:( BUT they offered to sell me them for half price. Ok, not a bad deal. They also had advertised on their website "limited time shipping & handling & taxes included." But when I asked them about that, they said it was an error and refused to honor it. That was just too shady for my taste. I went back on the website the next day, and the "error" was still there. Needless to say, I decided to take my business elsewhere. So to sum up :)...headphones sound good, but don't last, and vmoda's business practices are questionable.
