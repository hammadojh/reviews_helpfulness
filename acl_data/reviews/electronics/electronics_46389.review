Score: 2.0/5.0

Summary: Great sound quality can't save their cheapness.
     It has been established already that these headphones offer great bass quality at an affordable price, and for that they earn my applause, but every review I have read fails to mention their one greatest flaw. These headphones don't last. I bought my bass-freq headphones several months ago and for a while I was really pleased with them. The sound quality was great with lots of bass, just the way I like it, and I really liked their noise-canceling capabilities. If you had asked me to rate them a few months ago, I would without a doubt have given them a 5/5. However, some time after I bought them I noticed the casing around the wire had begun to separate where the wire split off to the left earpiece, revealing the bare wire underneath. I immediately covered the spot with electrical tape, which did hamper their overall look, but I no longer felt like a walking fire hazard. Shortly after, I noticed that more bare wiring was exposed below the right earpiece. Again, I covered the spot to the best of my ability, but their cheapness was beginning to make itself apparent. More time passed, and the sound became shoddy. I had to bend the wire a certain way where it connected to my mp3 player to get the normal quality sound, which was a pain. Before long it was impossible to get any kind of decent sound out of them anymore. After only four and a half months I retired my v-moda bass-freqs to the trash can, sorely disappointed. If you don't mind replacing your headphones every four months, you wont find a better pair for the price. Otherwise, look elsewhere, because these things just aren't built to last.
