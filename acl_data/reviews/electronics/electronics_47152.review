Summary: YOU CANNOT BEAT THIS SYSTEM!!!! BILLION + STARS!!!!!!!
     : ) I bought this system for around $300.00 (shipping included) could not be happier! The best thing i ever purchased, better than ny new car. Logitech is one of my favorite manufacturers of electronics, i have their wireless keyboard and optical mouse now the great sound system. YOU CANT EVEN CALL THEM COMPUTER SPEAKERS.. they are MORE THAN THAT! A Home theater! for your computer.. they are well worth the price i paid and more. for this price you can buy multiple of these systems to equal one tiny bose system. Hook these up to your computer, game system , and tv/dvd player. the inputs on the controller are teriffic! THIS THING IS HUGE! it is much larger then it appears on screen. you need more than one person to carry it in, a forklift, or a hand truck. everything comes packaged in an enormous box filled with 100's of plastic baggies. everything is indavidually wrapped and secured. I ordered my from amazon NEW because it was the best deal i found around. even on ebay they wanted an outrageous amount for a used system. THIS IS A GREAT DEAL BUY FROM AMAZON. com . it took 1 day from when i ordered it to get to my house in NY! amazed! A good SOUNDCARD to go with this system is the Creative soundblaster audigy2 ZS or platium. THE BASS Shakes the pictures of the wall in my 10' x 12' room, i just smile as it vibrates through my brainYOU WONT REGRET IT !
