Score: 5.0/5.0

Summary: Excellent value
     The cans have no right sounding this good for the amount paid. There a natural sound to them. Clarity is excellent so every detail is heard. These are lightyears ahead of earbuds and even some more expensive headphones. Not for the bass-thumpers though, but these deliver the accurate amount of bass, as well as other frequencies. Comfort is subjective, but these are not the Armanis of the headphone industry. You can get the hang of putting them on so they feel all right. At least they're light so you won't sprain your neck. If sound quality and price are your main objectives; again these headphones just don't have any right sounding this good. Five stars for sheer value, easy.
