Score: 5.0/5.0

Summary: Quiet and Cool
     The cooler sits under my 43 cm (large monitor) Macintosh Powerbook. The Powerbook is often on for 8 to 10 hours a day and keeps everything very cool. The cooler powers from the left-hand USB port. The pass-through USB plug enables the USB port to be used by a printer and other peripherals. There are two fan speed settings, high and low. I only run on the low setting. A good, solid, cost-effective choice.
