Score: 2.0/5.0

Summary: cheap subwoofers
     As I say in most of my reviews, you get what you pay for. I bought two of these in July, 2009 hoping that they would complement my existing Polk Audio speakers (which include a PSW125 12" subwoofer in the front of the room) in my great room. These are cheap subwoofers...very disappointing. They are great as a side table to put your drinks on them (make sure you use coasters)....and as another buyer wrote, if the wood veneer chips, you'll see the particle board underneat it. Don't turn the volume more than half way up otherwise you get distortion and muddiness. I regret buying them. Spend $400 and get some real subwoofers. If you already have good quality speakers, don't bother with these because they don't add much to them. If you are setting up a new system (2.1 or 5.1 or 7.1), look elsewhere. If you turn them up too high, you get muddy sounds for movies. Overall, it produces very mediocre sound. Those that gave it 4 and 5 stars obviously are people who have computer speakers or bookshelf speakers, live a small house or apartment, and/or have probably never owned high end stereo equipment. at $100, these are still overpriced. If $100 is your price range for subwoofers, consider getting a speaker set instead! You are wasting your money on an expensive paperweight. I'm looking at replacing these subwoofers with a single Klipsch SW-450 10" sub and just connecting my two polk subs next to the coffee table and use them as end tables to put drinks on them (seriously! ).
