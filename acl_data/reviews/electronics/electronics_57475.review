Summary: How low does it go?
     Notice the key piece of information missing from the product description? Even if you go to the manufacturer's page the same key piece of info is missing: the FREQUENCY RESPONSE! This speaker only goes down to 35Hz! My regular Aperion speakers go lower than that! All this speaker does is make low tones (but not the really low ones) louder and heavier. That's OK if you want sound effects, but you are missing the lowest notes in music. You need to find a speaker that will go to about 22-26 Hz. (Some subwoofers go as low as 18Hz, but at the frequency, its a feeling, a sensation rather than actual discernible pitch.) That may not seem like much of a difference, but at these low frequencies its 6-9 notes lower at the bottom end. Further, the manual doesn't indicate the rolloff which means those bottom notes are likely to be weak as they approach the 35Hz limit. If 35Hz is down -6db, that is significant because human ears can easily hear a -3db difference. And where exactly does that rolloff start?This speaker may seem impressive at first simply because you are powering some bottom frequencies out of balance with higher ones, but the day will come when you know there are low notes supposed to be there but the bottom just disappears. Do yourself a favor and spend a little more. This is REALLY a case of penny wise...
