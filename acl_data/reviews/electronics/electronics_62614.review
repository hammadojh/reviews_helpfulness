Summary: What a piece of junk!
     I bought version 4 of this router and had troubles from the very start. First, the range was terrible. I live in a two-story house and although I expected the signal strength to be somewhat degraded in the upstairs portion of the house, it was continually dropping the connection. Within the first 24 hours, I had to reset the entire network because it had stopped working altogether. Finally, I could not get it to work at all -and this was after only having it for less than a week. Tech support was horrible. Netgear contracts with computer techs in India, and in addition to having trouble understanding the accents, it was not unusual to be put on hold for up to an hour before somebody would pick up. I finally gave up and bought a Linksys router. (Model # WRT54GS) What a difference! The range and signal strength is fantastic, I had it up and running out of the box within 5 minutes, and I have yet to experience a dropped connection. After this experience, I will never buy another Netgear wireless product again. Save yourself some time and aggravation and go with Linksys.
