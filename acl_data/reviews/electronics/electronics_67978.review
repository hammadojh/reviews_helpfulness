Summary: Short Life
     I've hooked up my new Philips DVD player to my new Philips HDTV with this cable and everything ran nice and smooth... for exactly 11 days. Today it just died. My DVD player reports no signal and for some reason it makes the TV not responsive to any commands until I turn it off and on again. Really freaked me out until I finally figured out who the culprit is. Sorry, but even though it's cheap, I now realize that I really did get my money's worth on this one.
