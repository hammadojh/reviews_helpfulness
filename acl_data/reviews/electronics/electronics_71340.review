Summary: Doesn't work well with Windows
     Don't get an iPod if your main computer is Windows - mine didn't work when I got it, couldn't charge it, see it in My Computer, iTunes doesn't see it -we just get an error message reporting a malfunctioning USB device. Apple's tech support page says to fully charge the iPod before trying it on Windows. Great thanks for the catch 22 Apple, you don't ship the iPod with a charger - the only way to charge it is via the computer! So now we have to buy a 3rd party charger to get it to work - which is even harder because Apple used different connectors on various iPods (what the heck is wrong with using standard USB ports, Apple???) so our local Apple store (SimplyMac = OxyMoron) sold us the wrong charger and doesn't have one for our 4GB video nano. There are plenty of small video players out there that do work well with Windows - it's insane that Apple's iPod doesn't even work with Apple's iTunes while our old Creative mp3 player works with iTunes and other applications. I would avoid this product unless you only use a Mac (we have two but wanted a device that would work with our Windows machines as well:-(.
