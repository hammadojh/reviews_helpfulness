Summary: Canon Camera Backpack
     I used this backpack to carry a camera and two lense around Europe. The pack has plenty of room for the camera and accessories plus an addtional pocket big enough to carry magazines. Also, it has a mesh pocket and traps for tripods. It is an excellent value for the price. Other similar sized packs cost in the range of $80 to $100. Delivery was quick too...one week.
