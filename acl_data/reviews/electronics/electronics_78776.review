Summary: Not Worth It Even With The Discounts
     I usually don't write reviews, but I have to for this one. Looking at the other reviews for the e250 product, they made it sound real good, and there was the ~$90.00 discount; thats why i bought one. Mistake. When I got it, the picture quality and sound was perfect. At first, I thought the only con to this product was that you have to plug it to a computer to recharge it, but it was no biggie. But after I used it for 2 HOURS and I shut it off and was about to turn it back on, it didn't work. I looked at forums here and there, and many people with this mp3 also had the same problem. Some gave solutions, but even thought I tried them all, it still didn't work. In the end, I had to replace it, just like many others with this mp3 did. The only good thing is the picture and sound quality; I'll give you that, but what use is it when it doesn't work? Not worth the $110.00. I give you my word that it will break in a year if not sooner.
