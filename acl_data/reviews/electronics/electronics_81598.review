Summary: Zune Great, Software Lacking
     I received the black Zune as a Christmas present and am enjoying it so far. The device itself seems to have nearly everything I wanted in a personal audio/video device. What would make it a 5-star device is A/V mini-jack compatibility (video-out through the headphones), line-out in addition to headphone out, and a built-in FM transmitter. The internal software could probably be re-worked as updates occur, but I'd like to see an option - per song - to adjust the preset EQ. The Zune software itself is pretty slick, though I'm having trouble adjusting from my former favorite, MediaMonkey. The main feature I look for in media managers such as Zune or MediaMonkey is their ability to tag more easily and efficiently. MediaMonkey pulls song information from Amazon through a simple search system that I really like. The Zune software mysteriously updates songs as it sees fit - I didn't find anywhere to query the Zune catalog and refine my results. Sometimes I don't care if the metadata is the *right* data, just pertinent. And it is 2007 (mostly) now, shouldn't the Zune software and device fully recognize ID3 tags in their entirety? How cool would it be to have access to all the ID3 tag information on the handheld (e. g. lyrics, composer, year, genre, etc.).
