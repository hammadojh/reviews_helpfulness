Summary: Zune - defective battery
     On another note, it seems that I got a defective Zune (why would this be the case since it's the first batch of devices?). Anyway, the battery status is very inconsistent and moving up and down. I only played the Zune for 15 minutes and the battery is now half and falling below that margin after a fully charged. Being very nice to the device, I also turn off the Wireless feature, just to conserve on battery (what a joke that was). And yes! It was fully charged before I started using it. Contacted Amazon for a refund on this thing.
