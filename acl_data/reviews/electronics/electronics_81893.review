Score: 5.0/5.0

Summary: Easy-to-use, upgradeable, beautiful screen...
     I bought myself a Zune for my birthday back in November and love it. The screen is large and bright, and really shows off my album art. The body is rubbery and sturdy, and feels like you could drop-kick it and it would still keep playing. The software is very intuitive and makes it easy to maneuver through songs, artists, albums or playlists. The biggest selling point for me, though, was that the software is upgradeable; so, Microsoft can add new features (like games) for free, without your Zune becoming obsolete. And, finally, there's the wifi, which puts it head and shoulders over the others (including iPod). I don't know anyone who owns a Zune who's been disappointed. And most people who've seen mine have been impressed, especially with the large screen. Hope you like yours.
