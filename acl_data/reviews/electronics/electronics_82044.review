Score: 5.0/5.0

Summary: MS may have got it right this time...
     Just bought one of these babies and I really like it. They didnt copy that annoyingly touchy thumb wheel from the Ipod and it is considerably easier to navigate through menus. It came with a free 14 day trial so I have unlimited downloads from their marketplace. I was admittedly apprehensive about their music selection but was pleasantly surprised that they seem to have all 30 or so artists that I enjoy (from White Zombie, Puddle of Mudd to Hoobastank). I did have to re-download a couple of songs from the marketplace (free unlimited downloads thank god) that would not transfer from Itunes due to Apple's annoying need to utilize their exclusive m4p filetype. Luckly, it had no probem transferring my movies and pictures. I am very happy to ditch Itunes since it doesnt "play nice" with ANY of my other devices and tends to crash my system. The Zune marketplace seems to work fine and allows me to do things like download a new song and transfer it to my phone's ringtone. The customization of the Zune Marketplace interface needs a little work, but knowing MS they will catch up fast. Yes, I bought the brown one and it is really not a bad color at all. The green tinge looks cool too. I gave my video Ipod to my husband :) Although after seeing my Zune, he's not really that happy about my "gift".
