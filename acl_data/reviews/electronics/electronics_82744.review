     the microsoft zune....such a contrivertial productwell let me start with thisi like it better than the ipod don't get riled up it's my opinioni think the actuall device is damn near perfectthe navigation is great not to mention simpleit feels at home in your handand it(like so many others have said) doesn't attract finger prints. the screen is great i really like what they did with ithowever there are some negetive things i'd like to point outthe software for the zunehas got to be one of the worst i've ever usedquite aggrivating in fact, no i didn't have a problem installing itbut it's got so many elementsyou would not expect in a music managing program post itunes.....i really hope they fix itbut all in allthe zune is a worthwhile purchaceand i'm glad i bought it=]
