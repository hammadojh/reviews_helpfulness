Score: 3.0/5.0

Summary: Need better marketing people
     I finally broke down and bought one of these, based on recommendations by fellow musicians. I wish the people who make these devices would be more aware that people other than 19 year old mindless fans of pop music are interested in carrying around their personal music collections. I was TOTALLY turned OFF by i-pod in the past because the advertising focuses on downloading "songs" from their i-tunes, etc... Does that mean I can download over 500 symphonies, operas, or piano concertos, too? I wish they'd clarify what 500 "songs" means. Is a five hour opera one "song?" I will find out when I get the thing in the mail. But, at any rate, I wish they'd rethink their marketing, and try to cater to a wider public, rather than the uneducated masses. And, by the way, a symphony, piano piece, chamber work, etc. is not a "song! " Thanks for letting me spew. Fed up with pop music, and those that perpetuate it....
