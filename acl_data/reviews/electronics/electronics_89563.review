Score: 3.0/5.0

Summary: Totally unusable
     ConsA little overpriced. I was somewhat dissappointed in the hissing (white) noise that is discernable in quieter passages. They are a little heavy and will fall off your head if you bend over to pick something off the floor. ProsBetter than average (not for the price) sound quality. No wires!
