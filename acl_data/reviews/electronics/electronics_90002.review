Score: 4.0/5.0

Summary: Great for the price!
     After wrestling with the tough decision of which headphones to purchase, I settled on these. I love them! I use them with my stereo, and I haven't had any problem with hissing in the background. There is a dial right on the headphone to adjust the reception to get clear sound. I can walk all over my house and not lose my music. The only reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is (as another reviewer pointed out) the headphones--although very comfortable---come off my head when looking downward. Overall I am very pleased with these wireless headphones!
