Score: 5.0/5.0

Summary: Really, Really, Painful
     These sound better than my Koss Pro 4AA's which I paid $100 for, and sound almost as good as my Bose Triports. I went through 3 pairs of Bose Triport headphones before giving up on them. They are incredibly flimsy at the swivel joints on each ear; each broke after about 3 months of use just putting them on and off my head, and I don't have a big head. I'm not a kid and I take care of my stuff, not abusing them at all. The Koss heaphones are VERY heavy and do not have the full sound that these have. I picked up a pair of these Sony's at Walmart for a quick fix and they turned out to be great -- light, good sound, inexpensive, robust. These I've dropped several times and they are fine.
