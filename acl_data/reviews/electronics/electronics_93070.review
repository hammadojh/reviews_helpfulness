Score: 3.0/5.0

Summary: Good on paper but DOA
     It plays all advertized formats. The ac-3 sound is fantastic. But the video quality out of the s-video output is bad. My 5 year all Panasonic A-110 is far superior. After two days of playing with it I ended up guiving it to my inlaws and keeping my Panasonic. I can't comment about the component video output but the s-video is not acceptable. Mine came with the latest sofware and I tryed every possible adjustment without improvement. The image has a VCR quality at best...Sorry Phil! ..NiceTry! ;(
