Score: 2.0/5.0

Summary: Disappointed - No Improvement Over Cheaper Alternatives
     So many people have given this adapter 5 star reviews that I was expecting great things. It didn't happen. This Wireless G adapter gives less signal strength and NO speed improvement over an old $10 Wireless B adapter I'd been using. And yes, I upgraded to Wireless G from my "send" unit, and yes, I've got a Tivo with USB 2.0 which should allow faster transfer speeds. In trying to transmit about 35 feet, all on the same floor, through a couple of walls, the best signal strength I can get is about 30%, compared to 45% on an older Dlink adapter. In testing downloads to a Mac, which is really the only reason I wanted a speed boost, there was no improvement at all. I stand in the minority, but I'll just say that the adapter I received is overpriced and underpowered. It's going back.
