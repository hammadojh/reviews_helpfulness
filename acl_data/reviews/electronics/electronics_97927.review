Score: 4.0/5.0

Summary: Great buy if you run on the streets... only.
     This is the best GPS running device I have ever owned. It took some time to find the satellites the first time, but now it usually takes about 1 min. I haven't experienced a single satellite los yet. The Training Center could need some development thou!
