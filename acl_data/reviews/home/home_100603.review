Summary: Wonderful Mixer, Wrong Color
     I have to preface this to say that the Kitchen Aid is a universally wonderful mixer. I am not reviewing its function. What I AM reviewing however, is that I bought this mixer thinking that it looked teal in the photos and I hadn't seen that color anywhere else (it happens to be my favorite color). Nowhere in the description of the ad does it list the actual name of the color. I got it in the mail today. It's not the blue-green it looks in the photo; it's forest green- a dark green. Unfortunately, this will not work for me, so it's going back to Amazon. I just wanted to let everyone know officially that THIS mixer's color is BAYLEAF. Dark Green!
