Summary: I LOVE IT
     My husband got me this mixer for christmas this year. I received it yesterday and put it to work. It worked like a dream. I just love it. No more standing there with a hand mixer wishing I could reach something I needed. My mother has had one for a few years and she just loves hers too. She bakes almost everyday and uses her KITCHENAID. It is worth the money(I GOT MINE ONSALE HERE AT AMAZON).
