Summary: Kitchenaid - Industrial quality with a consumer price
     My family has burned out many blenders before there time. The Kitchenaid seems to be the answer. The blender is far more robust than any other blender we have owned, doing tasks like crushing ice with ease. Smoothies actually reflect there name - smooth! Being a family of 5 we appreciate the larger pitcher as well. You can't go wrong with this model.
