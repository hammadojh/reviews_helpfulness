Summary: very satisfied user of PUR filters
     I have been using this filteration system for 4 years. One summer, I even took this filter with the pitcher to visit my family in India. I usually come down with a bout or two of stomach upset when I am visiting India. This time I did not have any problem. In the US the filter has performed very well. After the "new filter" taste goes away, the water tastes very good. My children never had any problem either. I don't know how cost effective it is over delivered drinking water, but it is certainly more convenient for some one like me who has back problems and cannot lift heavy 5 gallon water bottles.
