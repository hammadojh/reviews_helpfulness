Score: 2.0/5.0

Summary: PUR not so pure
     The filters delivered were below the quality of the filters that I have been using for years. The filters did not have the replacement indicator that has been on every filter that I have had before. While that might be acceptable, the real problem is a very fine carbon residue that was deposited in the container. I probably will not order these again.
