Summary: Hot Hot Hot
     If you like your coffee strong and piping hot, look no further. I have gone through 5 coffee makers in 4 years (3 drip, 2 thermal carafes) and have not been satisfied until I purchased the percolator. It is very quick, the brew is strong, and the temperature is EXTREMELY hot (which for me is a good thing). The only drawback is the burnt taste of the coffee left in the pot for a second cup, but this is goes with percolator territory and is not singular to Farberware. So get a big mug, have one large cup of coffee, and you're all set.
