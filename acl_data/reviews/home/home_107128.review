Score: 4.0/5.0

Summary: Excellent product
     I ordered this juicer on Sunday and it arrived today to my big surprise (free shipping! ) I could not wait to use it and got apple juice and carrot juice already. It's a great product and I like it a lot. The cleaning is actually a bit more time consuming (3-4 minutes?) but this is totally worth the price and so great to have fresh juice made at home!
