Summary: Thank God for Customer Reviews!
     To everyone who left a review-Thanks. Dalmations are so white because all they do is shed. With construction and red dirt thrown in, my carpets were a mess. Had a Kenmore Progressive that died in 2 years. I read the reviews how the Eureka took care of dog hair and pull the nap of the carpet until it looked like new. Let me tell you-IT DOES. I've had 6 vacuums. Kenmore, Hoover whirlwind, Oreck xl, Roomba, Dirt Devil-guaranteed to break in one week and the Eureka cleans the best. My carpet looks great. The wide head vacuumed super fast. A must have for people who have dogs and dirt.
