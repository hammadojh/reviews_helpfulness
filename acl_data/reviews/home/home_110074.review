Summary: Do you really need a 6 quart mixer?
     You think I would learn after sending back two of these beasts because they quit running within the first week of ownership while mixing a smiple bread recipe; I ordered this one again for the third time hoping the new machine wouldn't sound like a deisel truck. I wanted a mixer with the larger capacity and I can live with the noise if it performs without suddingly stopping as the first two did. Unfortunately the steel gears are very noisy compared to the 4 1/2 quart mixer I've used for twenty years and you would think KitchenAid would address this grinding noise within their booklet. Another thing I dislike about the 6 quart mixer is the inability to tilt the motor head to access your beaters and product within the bowl. If this one quits as the other two did, I will surely order a 5 quart mixer with a tilting motor head next time.
