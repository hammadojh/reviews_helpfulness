Summary: Model apparently does NOT qualify for rebate
     If you note the model # on this item--then go to the rebate form and check it against the qualifying model #s--you'll see that it is not listed as qualifying for the $50 rebate. I just called KitchenAid...their rebate people said they've been getting calls, and this model indeed does not qualify for the rebate. Too bad--would have snapped it up in a second.
