Summary: I love this thing - and here's a fix when it doesn't work . . .
     Ok, I love this coffee maker. Makes a super full-bodied, robust, aromatic cup in seconds. Just love it. Then, after 5 months, it stopped brewing -- in much the same way many on the site here report that theirs did. I was able to fix it, though -- I've read that several people have removed and cleaned the filter basket assembly. That's good -- but the secret is to take a paper clip and unclog the TOP needle, not just the bottom one in the filter assembly. There are three holes in that top needle -- I eased the paper clip into each one, twisted it gently, then brewed a couple cups of water (which were chock full of coffee grounds). Once done (it just took, literally, a few minutes and was easy) I was back in the game with full, rich coffee again. Hopefully this helps some of you who have run into this issue -- it really was easy, and I've not had any issues since. I initially thought it was my water pump -- but it was that top needle & line that was clogged -- so don't hesitate to try this fix before you throw your hands up in surrender. I love the coffee this thing produces so much that this was a minor price to pay. Good luck -- and here's betting this little tip will help you keep enjoying yours, too.
