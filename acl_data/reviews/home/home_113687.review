Summary: Don't believe a word they say!
     These sheets are nothing like what is described on this page. Cafe - not. They are a horrible gold. 600 thread count sateen - not. They are as stiff as cheap percale. This stiffness is what angers me the most. They feel like a really over-starched shirt, even after washing. I don't buy high-thread count sheets for stiffness. I buy them for their softness. Do not buy these!
