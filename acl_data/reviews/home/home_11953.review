Summary: You guys have got to be kidding me! Four stars?!?
     This thing is terrible. Granted, I have NEVER been satisfied with an air mattress. They're horrible, useless things. I'd rather sleep on the thermarest sleeping pad I take backpacking. So the only explanation I can think of for the average 4 star review is that the bar is set so low for these things that any product that doesn't explode on inflation warrants 4 stars. There's no way to sleep comfortably on this mattress. When fully inflated the top of the mattress is so concave that it's uncomfortable for one person and absolutely impossible for a couple. Two people sleeping on this thing would have to work VERY hard not to end up on top of each other. I suppose there's a place for that, but I'm not about to force it on my poor guests. I feel like an idiot for trying one more air mattress before giving up entirely. I was duped by the four star rating. Do not buy this thing. It's worthless. It's so useless that it makes me miss futons. I would rather time travel back to 1992 and sleep on a futon than sleep on this mattress. Also, it's about 17 feet high. Maybe this explains why it's concave on the top, so hapless sleepers don't roll off and fall to their deaths.
