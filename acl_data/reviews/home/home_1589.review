Summary: Disappointed
     Keurig B70 Gourmet Single-Cup Home Brewing Systemis just a disappointment. It has some nice features but it just doesn't make a strong enough cup of coffee if you choose to make the largest cup. It makes a decent tiny cup. Using the same size K cup to make a small to xlarge cup just doesn't work. The brewing time is the same, so if it drips more water through the same amount of grounds, how can you get the same strength for the large cup of coffee? I bought the Senseo Supreme and it's great. You can insert 2 pods to make the large cup.
