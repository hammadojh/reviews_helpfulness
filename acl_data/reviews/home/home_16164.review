Summary: Bulletproof
     These are the most versitile sheets on the market. They are bulletproof, rough and can be used for collecting leaves in the yard, painting drop cloth, and other heavy industrial uses. I can imagine wet they could cut through steel too. Also sandpaper, 100 grit or emery paper to sand down pipes or deburr copper pipesYou can sleep on them too, and if someone tries to shoot you while you sleep these sheets will probably stop a .45 round at close range. Soft? Hell no, we don't need soft. These sheets are so hard they probably will be used to line hulls of the new battleships. Get the picture?
