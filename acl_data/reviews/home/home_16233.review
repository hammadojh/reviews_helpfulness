Summary: Doesnt stay hot or on.
     Im a coffee pro! And let me tell you thiscoffee maker really is not good. The platedoesnt stay on after the coffee is made, andit gets actaully cool after less than 30 minutes. It doesnt even make a good tasting coffee. What a waste of money. The good news is Cuisinartmakes other coffee makers that are wonderful.
