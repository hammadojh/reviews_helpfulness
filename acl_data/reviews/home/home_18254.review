Summary: The Giver Review
     This was not good literature based on three main reasons. I wasn't very interested while reading this book because it was first upsetting, secondly the ending was not what I expected, and finally it is disgusting. It was upsetting because they had no feelings for little children. If you were a twin they would weigh you and if you weighed less you would be released. Also, the ending wasn't good at all because it just ends, when you want to know more. Some of the memories the Giver transferred were disgusting. For example, when Jonas was sledding and hit a tree and he saw his own flesh and was bleeding. A quote to support my answer is then ending of the book, " Behind him, across a vast distances of space and time, from the place he had left, he thought he heard music too. But perhaps it was only an echo." The way the book ended was confusing because it seemed that there should be more too it, but there wasn't. As you can see, this text is not good literature.
