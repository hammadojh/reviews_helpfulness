Summary: I did NOT like this book
     I have enjoyed previous books by this author, but this is one I did not like. Rarely do I dislike a book, but this is at the top of my absolutely did not like list. I will say that it is powerful and thought-provoking reading, but I felt my soul, my being, was being ripped apart, and all that I have believed and hoped in was being questioned
