Summary: The best grind and brew
     This is definitely the best grind and brew coffeemaker available, and I love it. As I write this, I am drinking an amazing cup of coffee made by it. I know the Cuisinart quite well, and the Melitta is a far superior machine. All automatic grinders are going to make noise, but the Melitta is comparatively quiet, easy to operate and clean, and has a timer. I recommend it wholeheartedly. Two friends have bought it and love it, too. No filters ever again, no more coffee grinds all over the counter, and the coffee really tastes fresh. It is also the smallest grind and brew out there. After you first get it, you have to experiment a little with the grind time, which will affect the strength of your coffee. But anyone who has ever used a coffee grinder will master this in about two pots of coffee. Great product.
