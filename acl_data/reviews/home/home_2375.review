Summary: My favorite kitchen gadget
     After hearing so many problems with bacteria in the salad bags, I have decided to buy my own lettuce and vegetables. I could never get them dry enough and I don't like soggy salad. The OXO salad spinner is a worthwhile tool. I spin the lettuce or vegetables and am able to store them with the cover top. It does take up alot of space in the refrigerator but my lettuce greens stay greener longer. I would recommend this to anyone. An extra bonus, the kids like to play with it too.
