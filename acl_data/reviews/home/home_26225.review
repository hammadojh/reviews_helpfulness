Score: 5.0/5.0

Summary: Outstanding!
     These sheets are amazing when doing the nasty! When I'm on top and really into it my girl slides all the way till her head hits the headboard (lets me know I'm doing well). The sheets are very comfortable and soft. I bought a Queen and they are a bit long. I ended up pulling the top tight to the bottom and tucking in the excess sheet. Everytime I look at my bed I want to take my gf into it and take care of business (^_^)
