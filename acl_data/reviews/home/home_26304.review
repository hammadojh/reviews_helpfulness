Summary: Great sheets for the price but...
     These sheets are great. They are a bit stiff out of the package but soften up after the first wash. The stiching is simple, nothing fancy and no fancy hems. But for the price you can't complain. They feel wonderful and look great. But, for this price I'd suggest going to the 800 thread count sheets. Same price, same quality, but more luxurious feel. They are available from amazon as well. I purchased one set of these and 2 of the 800. If I could do it again I'd order 3 of the 800s.
