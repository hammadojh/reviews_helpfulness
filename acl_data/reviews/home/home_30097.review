Summary: Don't even think about espresso grind.
     I received this for Christmas and was all excited about replacing my beat-up (10 year old) Braun. I could not be more disappointed. The marketing BS on the box indicates that it grinds from Extra Coarse to Ultra Fine. No way! The finest grind is a drip grind at best; you cannot pack it at all for espresso, so the result is watery, bitter coffee. Just terrible. Stick with Braun's products - they work as advertised and they're nearly indestructable.
