Summary: it is a LIE !!!
     Do not believe the rebate deal. It's a lie. I never receive my $50 cash rebate, even though I know that they definitely receive my rebate information. The food mixer itself is just like other mixers, it is workable, no outstanding function. However, be careful to deal with those big companies, we consumers always could be take a advantage by them!
