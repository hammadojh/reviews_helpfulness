Summary: I've been using this electric kettle for a year.
     I pretty much agree with all the other positive reviews. I've had this Aroma kettle for a year and it gets used twice a day. It's very well designed, looks attractive, boils a full pot in under 5 minutes, turns off automatically, and the plug-in power base unit can be left plugged into your AC outlet. I should point out that the hinged top cap must be closed because that is part of the auto-off switch. When the cap is tightly snapped closed the steam that builds up upon the water coming to a boil is directed through the handle to the on-off switch and trips the switch off. If the cap is NOT closed the unit does not shut off. I've never let the kettle run with less than 2 cups of water and I'm sure it has a fail-safe turn off thermostat or switch should it run out of water. The kettle also turns off automatically when you lift it off the power base. In the past few weeks I have noticed an electrical smell coming from the heater section (bottom of kettle - not the water section) and I think it's going to fail shortly. Like everything else, it's made in China and I can't even find a company website but I'm buying another as backup because it seems to be a good value even if I only get a year out of it.
