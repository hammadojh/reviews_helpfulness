Summary: After having others, simply the best.
     I love robust black coffee, and use my coffeemaker at least twice a day. After burning through a Braun and a Krups a few years ago, I purchased this model three years ago after an exhaustive bit of research. It's the best ever, and so good that I have recommended it to friends and family, and just purchased one as a thank you gift for a couple who were getting by with an ancient, dribbling Mr. Coffee at their vacation home. A tip for those who like their brew extra strong - press the 1-4 cups button to allow for slower water flow, thereby producing a stronger result without having to add additional coffee. although it comes with the gold tone filter, I prefer the convenience of disposable paper filters ($1.60 for 100 at Trader Joe's). Also, I'm not sure why other reviewers have complanied about difficulty filling the water receptacle. Have never encountered any issues with this - simply use the carafe and pour.
