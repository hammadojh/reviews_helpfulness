     I just had an on-line chat with KitchenAid and this is the conversation. The rebate DOES apply to this mixer if bought from Amazon. comWP: Are your mixers still made in the USA?Janine C.:Our stand mixers are assembled in Greenville Ohio. The gear box cover on that mixer has been metal for many years. It will qualify for that rebate as long as it is purchased from an authorized retailer that is not excluded on the form. WP: I wanted to purchase from Amazon. com due to the sale today. Will that qualify?Janine C.: The excluded companies are Bed, Bath and Beyond, Macy's and Lowe's. It would qualify for that rebate, yes. WP: Ok thank you.
