Score: 3.0/5.0

Summary: is okay
     for the price I paid, I was disappointed in the expresso maker. After only 1 month the green 'ready' light went out. Also the distance between where the coffee drips and the base of the machine is very very short. An espresso cup hardly fits. I have had DeLonghi in the past and had great machines, but this one is not up to DeLonghi quality.
