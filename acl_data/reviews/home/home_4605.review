Summary: Kitchen Aid says the mixer DOES in fact QUALIFY for REBATE
     I ordered this mixer because it has over 850 5 star reviews and only 120 or so negative (1 star) reviews, so apparently people love it 8 to 1. Sounds like everybody has different needs/expectations and one size doesn't fit all. I also called the Kitchen Aid customer service number and they said the mixer has the METAL gearbox and DOES qualify for the rebate. They said there is a typo on the rebate form and that one should simply hand write the model number on the form.
