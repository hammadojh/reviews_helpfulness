Score: 5.0/5.0

Summary: Great vacuum
     Based on other reviews that were posted on Amazon and that the price was right, I purchased the Hoover Wind Tunnel Electronic. It has been a great machine. I really like having all the controls right there on the handle and the suction is tremendous. It pulls out dirt our old machine wouldn't touch. And no bags to worry about. The canister fills quickly so it has to be emptied more often, but that hasn't been a problem.
