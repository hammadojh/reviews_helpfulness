Summary: Calphalon everyday pan
     I bought one of these a year ago, then bought another one as a gift for my married son. I use it for literally every type of cooking from saute' to fry to boil. The heat energy is captured inside the pan's contents for more even and efficient cooking, much like a wok. It doesn't seem to scorch or burn food as easily as other pans and it's also very easy to clean. Don't know what I did before I purchased mine.
