Summary: Awesome Suction
     This vacuum really, well, sucks! It is like having a 12 Amp unit in your hand. The only downsides I see are the hose is short and there is no brush attachment. I think one can be ordered from Eureka though. Still, I think this is the best hand-held on the market considering it's price.
