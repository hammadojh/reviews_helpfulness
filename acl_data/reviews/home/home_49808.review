Score: 3.0/5.0

Summary: Great product that needs better quality control.
     One of my two glasses had water in the interior after I washed it. Afterthe second washing it had even more water in it. And no way is thatwater coming out. Despite this flaw, I'm probably going to take a chanceand order some more. I really like them for hot drinks.
