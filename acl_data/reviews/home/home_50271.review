Summary: It is great
     I love this item and use it nearly every day. I must admit that like most products it doesn't work exactly like the previews and video's but you find your own way to do it the way you want. It not only saves a ton of time but it makes things that also saves you money. I recommend anything that you use with tomatoes you actually blend those separately to get the right consistancy and then add it to the other ingredients. I also recommend anything that calls for cheese (i. e. Omelet) that you use shredded cheese and add later unless it's something like a cheese dip.
