Summary: very disappointed
     After reading so many positive reviews, and since i only drink espresso, i bought the product hoping to finally resolve my home coffee problems. After numerous attempts i find i am having the same problems as some of the other negative reviews. one, i am using a lot of coffee to make one cup, 2) the serving i get is barely one shot of espresso and 3) i find the actual brew too mild and weak. i have tried using more coffee but cant seem to get it right and i am sure that i am using it correctly. guess i will have to go back to the moka maker
