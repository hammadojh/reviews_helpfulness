Summary: Not for Dogs and allergies
     The product worked well. The suction was powerful. The problem came when emptying dirt and cleaning the filter. My dog sheds, I would have to clean out this machine 3 times before finishing. To clean the machine you must pull the hair out by hand and then use a toothbrush on the filter bag. After that you may rinse the bag and replace when dry. It would have been perfect with removable bag.
