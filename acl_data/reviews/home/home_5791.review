Summary: This is worse than the cheapest pan I used
     I usually pass the review request as I am mostly all right with the products. This time I really feel bad and I have to come here and say this is worse than the cheapest pan I used. It is slow to heat up, heavy to manuever, the worst thing is: it sticks so badly! I tried to do eggs and they stick everywhere. I could not believe it!
