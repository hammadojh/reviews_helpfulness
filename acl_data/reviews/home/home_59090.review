Summary: cook
     After reading all the positive reviews for this product, I decided to buy one and try it out. The mixer looks great, and the whole pre-frozen mixing bowl idea is very smart. This machine is also very simple and requires virtually no clean-up at all. however, I am a bit frustrated with it's performance. After appx. 10 minutes of operation the machine shuts off. The manual states that this is a safety mechanism to avoid over-heating the motor. The manual also states that the motor will resume operation in a &quot;FEW MINUTES&quot;. More than five minutes later, the machine resumes operation only to begin scraping the now frozen ice cream on the sides of the bowl which causes the motor to shut down after two more minutes. At this point I had to hand turn the scraper/paddle to keep the whole operation going before too many ice crystals form in the ice cream, and the bowl temperature rises too high. Now the motor resumes turning, but for less than a minute, so I have to hand turn the paddle untill the ice cream is firm enough to eat (a bit softer than frozen yogurt). After the ice cream is in the freezer, and I've begun cleaning, (about ten minutes later ) It turns on again! Quisinart, Read this: Put a better motor in this thing!
