Summary: With A Product As Good As This, Why Pay More?
     I love my Cuisinart ICE-20 Ice cream maker and would highly recommend it to anyone. I have made countless different recipes in it, and this machine makes creamy ice cream in mere minutes. I have also partly frozen the ice cream and then layered a combination of flavors creating a stunning semifredo dessert. When you can get Cuisinart quality at such a reasonable price, why pay more? The only problem I had was that the ice cream was so good I wanted to make more shortly after and the freezer bowl had not completely frozen again. An additional freezer bowl is on my Christmas wish list this year!
