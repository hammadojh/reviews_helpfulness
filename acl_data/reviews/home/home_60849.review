Score: 2.0/5.0

Summary: Cheap priced - cheap made.
     This vacuum is the cheap modification of the Hoover's upright bagged line. Pos.:- relatively light weight- vacuum suction power is good- not expensiveCons.:- not reliable:very cheap made- very noisy- short cable- short and cheap-plastic stretched hose- not a switchable rotating brushVacuum is very noisy(much more noisy than other models,even from Hoover), plus it makes terrible,very uncomfortable vibration in your grip,so after 5-10 minutes of its work you will wish to shut it off. I was needed a second vacuum and after reading many reviews and "consumer report" finally bought a brand new on Amazon(free shipping,very fast delivery). This vacuum was used 2-3 times a week. During first 3 weeks I had to replace the belt twice and eventually the cradle of the rotating brush has been crashed out(again, vacuum has not been hardly used). Apropos,my main old(6 years old)vacuum-Hoover(supreme series-very similar,but more expensive and much more quality made) is still in working condition,while this one is waste of 59$ . Absolutely not agree with "consumer report" here!
