Summary: Hoover Vacuum is good for money
     The Hoover Tempo has great suction power and works well on carpet. There are a couple things that are a problem but for the money - I am pleased with it's performance. It is loud, has a very short electrical cord, and the hose length is very short and if you pull it, the vacuum tips over - watch out with little ones! I care most about it picking up the items on the floor and it's good at that!
