Summary: Fun and Function
     What's not to love about this cute cow humidifier? My 18 month old son loves talking to his "friend" in the morning when he wakes. I purchased this humidifier specifically because it is ultrasonic and needs no filter (unlike many of the VICKS brand which we have used in the past) and the cute factor is a bonus. It runs whisper-silent, is easy to refill and adjust the moisture output and clean. Excellent design, excellent product.
