Summary: Love it
     I LOVE my bread machine. It does not come with enough recipes, but the Betty Crocker bread machine cookbook has more than enough delicious recipes, most of which work perfectly with this bread machine. The basic white bread from that cookbook is my favorite white bread that I have ever eaten. I like that this bread machine is so easy to use, because the yeast has its own separate compartment, so you don't have to worry about getting it wet. Also, the flour is weighed on a scale, which is much easier, faster and cleaner than sifting and spooning the flour. You will have to buy the scale separately, but a scale can be very useful even outside of making bread. Some good things to know about this machine:it can be set on a timer;it is a little bit louder than the Zojirushi;it does shake a little bit and occassionally will "walk" a little on the counter;it is designed very simply and therefore not bad looking;it makes hot, fresh, yummy-smelling, super delicious bread;it takes only about 4 minutes to prepare and preparing it is easy;it can make small, medium or large loaves;it is very durable - I have had mine for over 2 years and it is still in perfect working condition.
