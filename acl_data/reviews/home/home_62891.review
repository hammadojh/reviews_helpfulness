Summary: Highly Reccomend This Bread Maker
     This is my first bread machine and I compared it to several others. I am VERY pleased with this machine, I have made 14 loafs and each one has turned out great. Very easy to use, quiet, and has a 13 hour timer which works well. The bread comes out very easy from the pan and if you place warm water in the pan after cooking it cleans up with ease. I have not found anything negative about this machine yet.
