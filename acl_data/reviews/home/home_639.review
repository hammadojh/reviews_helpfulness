Summary: How well it works depends largely on the shape of your mug
     A lot of reviewers have stated that this hot plate does not get warm enough to keep your coffee hot. I disagree, but also think I know why they are having that experience. How well this warmer works is extremely sensitive to the shape of your coffee mug, in particular the way that the bottom makes contact with the burner. I did some controlled experiments to determine how much heat this warmer puts into a liquid in a cup and found as much as 30 degrees of variation between different mugs of the same or similar material. The bottom line is that any hotplate style coffee warmer depends on maximum surface area contact with the bottom of your mug. If you have a mug that is broad and flat at the bottom, filling the heating surface of the warmer, it will work great. If you mug is very narrow at the bottom or arches up so that only the edge is touching, the heater cannot be as effective. You should either buy a different mug, or forego this energy wasting method altogether, in favor of a well-insulated stainless steel vacuum mug like the ones from Contigo. Personally, I like the taste of coffee best out of a real mug, so I continue to use this warmer, just with a broad based mug.
