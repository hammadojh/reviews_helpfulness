Summary: Might be cute, but the humidifier fails after 2 month
     I bought the penguin humidifier when my daughter had a cold. My wife and I picked it out, because it was cute, and a decent price. Every time we filled it, (and yes we followed all instructions with the unit) the output knob had to be adjusted, so that mist would come out. This just kept getting worse and worse. After about 60 days (using it only at night) the unit quit working. Evidently Crane does not exist on the internet, nor can you actually find who makes these units, to try to get a replacement. All in all a complete waste of $30. Dont get it. Get something more expensive, and a brand name you can trust.
