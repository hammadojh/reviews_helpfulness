Summary: Had it over a year... still going strong
     After looking at a few reviews talking about crazy malfunctions and stuff I had to at least let you know some people who own this thing haven't had that kind of trouble. I have had this trash can for over a year and I'm still using the original batteries. We have a small kitchen so that includes all of the false alarm openings that happen when you have the pantry door open up right next to the sensor. That's probably the only problem I have had, the trash can opening up when we don't have garbage to throw in (and that's because we are standing too close to the thing anyway). The can is a good size and does a great job in keeping the trash bags from falling into the can. Basically if you want a nice trash can like those stainless steel ones you see in Bed, Bath and Beyond this baby is of the same calibur and comes with a little bonus luxury. Between you and me I got the can at Costco at a much lower price than what I'm seeing here. You probably want to wait until there is a good deal on them just to make sure you get your money's worth. If I had to pay the kind of money they are asking for I would have just opted for a larger non-automatic can from BBB.
