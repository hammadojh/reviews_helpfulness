Summary: Fine Product; Needs One Feature
     We bought this unit over many others based on user recommendations. We are pleased with it except: You end up holding a giant bowl or grocery bag full of fresh popcorn, and you have to somehow reach over and pull the plug! Duh! How about a simple rocker/on-off switch on the front of the unit?
