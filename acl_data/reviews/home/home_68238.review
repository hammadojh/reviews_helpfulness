Summary: Useless
     Maybe I got a defective unit, but this product is absolutely useless. All it has to do is spin a blade, that's it. Yet, it can't even do that right. Half the time, the blade doesn't move and you have to force the blade a few revolutions with a knife before it will move of its own accord. And then it finally just failed completely, and I haven't had it much longer than a year.
