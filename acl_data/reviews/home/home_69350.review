Summary: Misto Gourmet oilive oil sprayer
     I bought this sprayer as a Christmas present and the person used it only 2 times and the white screw cap inside that holds the spray mechanism in place broke. It seems that this is a faulty part of the sprayer. I would like to know if I could get a replacement part for it. I was very disapointed in this product due to it breaking.
