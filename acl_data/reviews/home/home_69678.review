Summary: Great tool for grilling!
     I use my misto often for grilling veggies and seafood. It's a nice substitute for a brush, and makes it easier to oil things lightly. Negatives are that you have to pump frequently and sometimes the oil dribbles and is messy. But you can use it with flavored oils, spray while things are grilling or in the oven and you want to be quick, and it's simple to use. Also makes a great gift for people who like to cook.
