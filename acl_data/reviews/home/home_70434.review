Summary: Warm Heater
     I like it, but is doesn't have an automatic shut off. I only use the 400 watt sitting because my cats will snuggle right up to it. When the room gets warm you have to shut it off. you have to be very careful & make sure you turn it off. I'm 62 & use it occasionally when I'm in the room.
