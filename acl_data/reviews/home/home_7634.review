Summary: It's super cute but not really functional
     We got the green frog and it's really cute. But when my son had a cold, we couldn't get warm air to blow out. Then realized it only sends out cold mist. It's great in that the mist moisturizes the air, but I really wanted warm mist, which is really soothing. We have a humidifier from the 1970's, belonging to my parents, so we dragged that out and man, it just blasts the room with awesome hot mist and in no time he was feeling better. I see on the description that it says "COOL mist humidifier" but I had mistaken that all humidifiers gave off warm/hot air. I guess they want it child safe, but really, I"m not going to seat him right next to it. Anyway, if you want Cold mist, this is for you. Otherwise, get something more practical."
