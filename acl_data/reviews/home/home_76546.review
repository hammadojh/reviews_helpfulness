Summary: What The...
     I received the Hoover within a reasonable time frame. So far so good. The problems then became evident. The machine leaves stripes on the rug as it only cleans in narrow stripes. It sucked all of the detergent out of the nozzle before I could finish a small area. To clean an area of any dimension would take enough detergent to fill a number of 55 gallon drums. The device arrived missing the hose, hose holder and nozzle clean-out tool. The Hoover bunch said the only thing I could do is return the whole thing. Sure, let's think about how much that would cost not to mention the time and effort involved. Here it is almost two weeks later and contacting Amazon about the missing parts is like telling W. C. Fields you want an ice cream as a kid, " Go away kid...you bother me..."Not happy? What makes you think that???
