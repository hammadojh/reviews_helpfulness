Summary: Very disappointed... Want a refund
     All this product offers is a cute appearance. It does not produce enough mist, even at the max setting, to counter the driness in my toddler's room. When I observed the mist being produced through the kitty's ears over a week, I couldn't help but to think that a smoker could probably puff out a cigarette smoke bigger than that of this humidifier. Too bad, I can't return the product for a refund because I discard the packaging material.
