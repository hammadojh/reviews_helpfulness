Summary: The LOUDEST bed ever!
     I bought this travel bed for my 4 year old daughter after researching and reading all the reviews. I thought I made a good choice but the first night we used it, I realized it was a mistake. It was so LOUD! Every time my daughter turned, it would squeak so loudly it woke every one up, including my daughter. She refused to sleep on it the next night because it was so loud. I finally convinced her to go back on it by putting 2 extra comforters under the fitted. It made it a little better but still, it was loud. I didn't want to sleep in the same room. Reconsider purchasing this bed.
