Score: 1.0/5.0

Summary: Not colorfast
     While these sheets feel great, on the first wash the color bled. A lot! The bleeding continues with each wash. These sheets now have giant colorless blotches all over them. They were always laundered per instruction. They are only a few months old and they are useless.
