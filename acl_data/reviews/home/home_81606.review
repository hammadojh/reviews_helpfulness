Summary: A Cheap Chic's Guide to Affordable Luxury
     Just got these sheets at an unbelievable price. Believe me I am a sale hound, and I shopped around and compared thread counts, read reviews, and looked at prices on competitor websites. The competitors couldn't do a better price even with a 20 percent off coupon code. Bonus... Amazon gives free shipping! Item arrived way sooner than quoted arrival date. As far as the product, when I was pulling the sheets out of the package I was like, "wow these are the best feeling sheets I have ever touched and I can not wait to get them on my bed". These sheets have deep pockets and fit my mattress that is 18 inches deep. I bought the cafe' color because of its neutral versatility. I would recommend this set highly and am planning on getting another. Amazon Rocks for those trying to save money and still get nice stuff!
