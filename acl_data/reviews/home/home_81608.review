Summary: Not good for Pillow Tops at all
     I have a brand new queen size pillow top mattress, and wanted comfy sheets for it. These sheets are quite comfortable, very soft and thick. However, the fitted sheet doesn't fit on the mattress and the regular sheet can't be tucked into the sides at all. It's very hard to find sheet sets to fit these newer thick pillow tops.
