Summary: Great Buy
     I have found this pot a great buy comparing it to price of an equivalent pot made by Le Creuset. So far it seems to cook very nicely. What I don't know, of course, is whether it will last as long as Le Creuset, but if it doesn't, I will be able to buy this pot 5 times before the purchase will cost me as much as the Le Creuset!
