Summary: lodge enamel on cast iron 6 quart dutch oven, island spice
     This Dutch oven is absolutely gorgeous! An incredible value in the world of enameled cast iron these days, I have a Le Creuset dutch oven that I love, but wanted another piece that was smaller and to be completely honest, wanted to to test one of Lodge's new enameled cast iron pieces that are more price friendly. I have other lodge pieces which I love and thought it was worth a try. I have to admit I was lured by the beautiful red color. Now that I have received it and see it, the picture does not do it justice! It is so pretty, but it cooks superbly like my other lodge pieces, but clean up is so much easier and I don't have to oil each time. I can also cook dishes that are acidic that I can't in the regular cast iron. You also can cook at almost half the normal temps in the oven because it retains the heat so well, which is great with the price of electricity and gas right now! I really think these are going to take off with their affordable prices on these. They have the Lodge name security backing them and hopefully they have not sold their name to produce these like a lot of other companies these days, but I doubt it. But for under $50 for a 6 quart dutch oven, it is worth a try! I am very happy and showing all my friends and family. Do give these a try!
