Summary: Best Juicer I've Ever Owned....
     We've owned Omega, Campion, Juiceman and the Breville JE900. I looked at the Jack LaLanne, but the motor is 3x's less powerful and it isn't as well made. The Breville 800JEXL 1000 is the best one yet! We juice everything from fruit to veggies. Kale, some wheat grass, collards, mustard greens, beets, carrots, peppers, chard, ginger, garlic. Anything and everything. We make 4 batches of juice at one time - (4 quarts). (Although you can put whole apples in it, you might want to take the seeds out as they contain trace amounts of a cyanide compound) The 800JEXL isn't as noisy as the JE900. The basket is finer, too. The stainless steel body makes it easy to clean. It allows you to scrub the parts whereas you can't use abrasives on the plastic models. After a while, they get residue build up from juicing greens. The pulp is dry and minimal if you follow directions. Breville juicers are the easiest to clean. If you are considering a juicer, don't hesitate to buy this one. And from owning the JE900, I know the company stands behind their products.
