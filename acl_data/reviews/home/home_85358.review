Summary: GRRRRREAT!
     So far we LOVE this piece! HUGE is not appropriate! Very heavy too! Those features can be great and horrible depending on what you are doing! We have 6 in our family so I make bigger quantities and this thing holds 1/2 lb. of bacon and just tons of food! Very heavy and I was shocked at the Super Saver Free Shipping! The only thing I wish they had for it is a LID! I have not found where one was available to purchase for this and I would loved to have had one while that bacon was popping!
