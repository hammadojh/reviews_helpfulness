Summary: DO NOT PURCHASE THIS ITEM...YOU WILL BE SORRY!
     I purchased this skillet because of all the positive testimonials and because I am sick of buying new Siverstone and other non stick pans year after year. I realized this was not a non-stick product but given all the testimonials about the nonstick and easy cleanup perfromance, if cared for correctly, I was sold on the product! I received the skillet and it was very heavy...as expected. Even though it was "PRE-SEASONED" I followed instructions prior to first use and season it myself. The first item I cooked in the skillet was eggs over easy they stuck so badly it the result was more like scrambled eggs! Clean up was a nightmare. I figured the skillet needed to break in and needed more "seasoning" so I seasoned it per instruction 3 more times before the second use. On this occassion it was Hashbrowns, disaster! The potatoes stuck to the surface all over and again the pan was very difficult to clean up. Back to the seasoning proccess...the Cornbeef Hash..nightmare. I was disgusted at this point so I called Lodge directly. The customer service person was very uncaring and had an air of "I could care less about her". If your looking for anything more than a piece of iron in your cabinet DON"T BUY THIS PRODUCT! I very rarely to never write these type of comments good or bad, however I wanted others considering this purchase to know the facts and to know this company has no interest in backing up its products. Study before you purchase! Disappointed in Ohio!
