Summary: Silent, works great, and figured out the "fix!"
     This Crane elephant replaced our older one that was dropped and broke. It works extremely well, doesn't need filters, and is very quiet, except for the occasional dripping sound. During the first week we had it, it suddenly stopped working after I moved it while it was running. Finally, I dumped out all the water, refilled it, and it's worked problem-free ever since (so may moving it while on caused water to go where it shouldn't be). I particularly love the elephant model because you can aim the trunk to direct where you want the mist to go - in our case, right over our child's bed. The frog model is also great, but doesn't really enable you to aim the mist.
