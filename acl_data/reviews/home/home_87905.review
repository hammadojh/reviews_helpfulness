Summary: Not just for kids
     We bought this when I hit my annual bout of bronchitis and found that the old humidifier was pretty much dead. I honestly wasn't expecting much, just something that spits out some water and looks cute, with a higher price tag for the Kitty. I was pleasantly surprised to find that this is actually a very high-quality humidifier, with all of the bells and whistles found on others in the same price range. Others boast two settings, this one has an entire adjustable range of settings. It doesn't make a sound at all and it's easy to fill and to clean. The nightlight is cute, but not very useful, as the LED power indicator is extremely bright and puts out more light than the nightlight does. Still, though, it's a soft purple and very soothing to look at. Science has shown that happy thoughts can help contribute to quicker healing and recovery, and something this adorable can definitely add to that.
