Summary: The Best - No Question
     My wife and I are popcorn nuts. We located a great medium kernal yellow grown by the Amish in Indiana and have it shipped to us periodically. The best way by far to pop it is in a Stir Crazy with a little light olive oil. If you love popcorn you'll own and use a Stir Crazy. Microwave is not popcorn.
