Summary: Convenient but weak and expensive
     This looks like it would be wonderful for a quick cup of coffee or entertaining. And it is if you and your guests don't mind weak coffee. It does make good tea for my kids. I can run two of the smaller brews through a single tea k-cup to get a nice cup of tea. I wait a couple minutes between brews to let the tea steep in the k-cup. I've tried a few different "bold" k-cups and still found it to be too weak. My problem is compounded by the fact that my preferred coffee cup holds 16 ounces of coffee. Check the volume of your favorite cup first. I use a Pfaltzgraff cup (not a mug) and was surprised to find that it holds 16 ounces. My only solution is to use the refillable filter and add my own coffee. I use a fine grind and gently pack it into the filter. This of course removes most of the convenience of owning a Keurig. If you still want to buy one then go for the B40. The more expensive models are not worth it. Adding a smaller cup is a waste and it is fast enough that you don't need to program it. Besides more features just mean more things to go wrong.
