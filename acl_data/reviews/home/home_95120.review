Summary: Kitchen Victory with Victorinox
     I have long trusted America's Test Kitchen's opinion for all things culinary. So when they recommended the Black Fibrox 8 in. Victorinox Chef's Knife, as a best buy--right up there with blades at three times the price, I didn't think twice. I could not be happier with this knife. Light & easy in the hand, well-balanced, & razor sharp. Chops, slices, & dices with ease. I never realized how effortless a shorter blade makes everyday jobs. The 10" chef's knife is staying in the drawer.
