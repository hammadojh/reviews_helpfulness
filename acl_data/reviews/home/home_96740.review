Summary: Ice Cream Perfection With Little Effort
     This Cuisinart ICE-30BC makes the most perfect ice cream with little effort. I don't know why some reviewers had problems with theirs, but I really think the problem lies with how they were making the ice cream and not the product itself. I just got done making my very first batch of homeade ice cream and it came out perfectly. Here are some tips that will hopefully help you make ice cream perfection:1. Let the bowl freeze in the back of your freezer, leaving about 1 inch on every side so it doesn't touch the walls of the freezer or anything in your freezer. It is completely frozen when you shake it and don't hear liquid sloshing in it. (Mine took about 12 hours to freeze).2. Use the full-fat ingredients. (Whole milk, heavy cream). I know, it's fattening but if you use the weaker ingredients, the ice cream may come out weak (or soup-like).3. Follow the instructions on mixing the milk and the sugar with beaters for about 2 minutes before adding it to the machine. (In other words, don't just pour the milk and sugar into the machine without hand mixing them first).4. Use PURE vanilla extract, NOT imitation vanilla extract. (Imitation vanilla extract contains an ingredient that will break down the milk and cream, also causing the ice cream to become soup-like). Add this last, then let the machine churn it for about 7 minutes more. Your ice cream will come out to absolute perfection, and I hope you will be as happy with your Cuisinart ice cream maker as I am with mine!
