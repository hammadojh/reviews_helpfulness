Summary: Juicer with a Jet Engine
     This juice is so flippin' sweet I can't describe it in words. This juice is to fruit and veg what "Will it Blend?" is to blending (see: http://www. youtube.com/user/Blendtec).This juicer shreds whole apples in less than one second all while getting maximum juice and making an intimidating jet-engine sound from the 700-watt power. I've juiced kale, watercress, spinach, orange, grapefruits, grapes, apples, tomatoes, carrots--you name it. Not only does it juice super easy, it cleans up super easy as well. When I'm done juicing, I just take it apart and spray it down in the sink with my high pressure hose and sweep the evidence down the garbage disposal. You can also toss it in a dishwasher. I've heard it can maintain stains if you don't wash it promptly or later on down the line if you do a bunch of strongly colored items, but I've had mine since December and have happily juiced nearly every day since and it's as pretty as the day it was born. This is the best kitchen appliance purchased I've made in a long, long time! Just don't reenact the blender scene from Goonies with it.
