Summary: fabulous juicer
     Oh, it is a very good juicer for me. After several searches on the internet, I bought this machine. I need a juicer, which press real pure juice without a lot of pulp because I didn't like anything such as smoothie taste. This machine really does a very good job. It gives more juice with little pulp ---the pulp is actually in the foam like part on the top of the juice, you can just throw away those foam if you don't like any pulp. The power is fabulous, just within one minute you can get a 12oz pure fresh juice. The noise is ok, compare to any grinding machines and choppers I have. The brush to wash it has very good quality, and using it to wash the machine is very easy. The only downside for me is that it is a little bulky for me because I am the only one drink juice in my family, this machine should be perfect for the whole family. But if it is small, perhaps it will not be such powerful. So I think it is still a very good juicer.
