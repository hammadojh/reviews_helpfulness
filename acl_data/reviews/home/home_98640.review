Summary: Awesome Cleaner!
     I purchased this to clean my grout. All I can say is WOW! My floor has never been so clean. I spent about 5 minutes on each square because I had so much ground in dirt. Then I had to wipe it with a cloth. It took a long time because it was so dirty. The second time I cleaned the floors, it took less than an hour because the dirt was not so ground in. I gave this product only 4 stars because I tried to clean my stove that is white, but looks black from all the stains. The steamer did NOT clean this. Maybe it is not as powerful to clean such a mess. In all, I would definitely recommend this steamer if you want excellent cleaning with no chemicals.
