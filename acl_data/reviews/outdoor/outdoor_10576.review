Summary: GMC Denali 700C Road Bike
     When I bought my Denali, I wasn't sure what I was going to get for $149. So far, I am pleased with the product. I've gone on several 50 mile+ rides and have found the bike to be dependable and ride smoothly. However, the 1st time I rode it I got a flat from a faulty rim strip, which Kent Bicycles gladly replaced. Overall, the bike is a good value and a great bike for beginner cyclists or those looking for an inexpensive road bike.
