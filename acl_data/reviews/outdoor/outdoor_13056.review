Summary: Hardest workout that improved my running
     First, let me say that I have all the Jillian Michaels workouts, including her latest Ripped in 30, and I have Cathy Fredrich workouts including HITT, and run 3-4 miles a day, have P90X, have Chaleen Extreme, and Turbo Jam. I really like to workout at home. I have to say, in terms of cardiovascular endurance, muscular endurance and speed training, this is THE hardest workout I have ever done. I have been on Insanity for about 3 weeks now, and I am just now able to get through one of the workouts, which is only 38 minutes. The best part of this is that I am able to see my stomach muscles after 3 kids that I have not seen in 10 years. In addition, my running, especially going uphill, is hardly a workout anymore. I use to run with my dog, who I could not keep up with (he's a young lab) to now me having to pull and encourage him to keep going faster and keep up with me. I can easily run 5-6 miles, at a 9 minute pace and feel like I hardly break a sweat. I am 41 years old and feel like I am in the best shape of my life. Even though this is not a muscular building exercise, I have lost so much fat that I can clearly see ab muscles, shoulder and tricep muscles, back muscles, hamstring muscles. While this is hard and even the people in the video take breaks, for me, working out is not really working out unless it is effective in fat loss and strength and endurance building. It is worth the 40 minutes of panting!
