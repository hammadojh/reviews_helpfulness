Summary: Best cardio you'll ever get...SEROIUSLY!
     I started this program about six months ago thinking I was in good shape because I had been working out at the gym for 9 months. Insanity showed me I was wrong reallll quick. I could barely get through the fit test, the first time I started this workout. Needless to say, I got my butt handed to me during month 2. I started doing a rotation of month one to get my cardio up. I started the full 60 day routine almost two weeks ago now, and I'm loving every minute of it. I flew through the fit test this go around. This is seriously one of the best workouts you will ever get. I love hearing people ask me if I've been losing weight. It is the best feeling ever. I had knee problems prior to starting this program, and my knee rarely bothers me now. You just have to follow Shaun T's cues to protect your joints. I never thought I would swear by a workout video, but I now swear by this program. Your cardio will be up, and your body will change. Just stick with the program and invest in a good protein supplement to keep your muscles going. The pylo workouts are amazing and even in the recovery workout, your muscles are still on fire. So if you are serious about losing weight and putting your heart into working out, this is your program.
