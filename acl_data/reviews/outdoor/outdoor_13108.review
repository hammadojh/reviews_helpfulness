Summary: First one was scratched
     I bought this for my son. When he got around to the 4th DVD it was scratched and would not play properly. I had order a whole new system and return the other one for credit. I was disappointed to have to pay a &#34;restocking fee&#34;. Why should I be penalized for their faulty product?
