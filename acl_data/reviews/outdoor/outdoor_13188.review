Summary: Dieting and excercise is a waste of time and money.
     Hey all, Lately I've been going to McDonalds and other GREAT fast food chains and have noticed that they are starting to serve more healthy food and listing calories next to menu item. It is very irritating because I go to a great restaurant like McDonalds to enjoy delicious food, and not worry about prices or calories...I love my body and I am happy with having a gut and love handles. Anywho, at a recent doctor's visit my Doc said that i had atherosclerotic coronary artery disease and my arteries were 99% clogged. He tried to threaten me saying that if I kept up my lifestyle I would have about 6 months of life left in me and suggested I do a workout program such as Insanity to get "in shape". So I put this insanity DVD on and gave up after 30 seconds. Working out and healthy eating is a complete waste of time and effort! As a matter of fact, why would anyone want to look like a convict on death row! ? If I am going to life my life I am going to eat happy at great places like McDonalds, Burger King, and Jack in the Box. Also, my time is valuable to me and I would rather be watching good DVDs like Jersey Shore, Battlefield Earth, Freddy Got Fingered, and Catwoman.
