Summary: DVD Problems
     I ordered the set. I put the 2nd work out in and up comes the TV show Damages. The label is correct, but the content is something else. I try calling, but nobody picks up. I did the chat and they just promise someone will call. I will be returning these DVD in 48 hours if nobody calls be back. Talk about disappointed, I was all ready to start my 60 days to be stuck with this crap. It is too bad since they seem like a good workout.
