Summary: A Must if You Want a Real Grip - This is the Best.
     I've used Gripmaster for decades and have a powerful grip. My doctor once commented that he had never met male or female with the grip I had. I like mine (I use the black one) because it fits a woman's hands nicely while others are usually too wide and uncomfortable for the smaller female hand. I also like the way it gives you powerful fingers, hands and forearms. You'll feel the power after one use. Start with the lighter ones if you want and build up. If you're older and perhaps have arthritis, give them a try. Ask your doctor if it's okay. But I find the Gripmaster to be great and really give my hands and forearms a workout. I have some arthritis and these help me to keep it under control. I lift weights and know what a burn is. Believe me, Gripmaster will give you a burn and you'll quickly develop powerful hands for any sport or job, for protection or just to be in better shape and to be able to do more safely. Susanna K.
