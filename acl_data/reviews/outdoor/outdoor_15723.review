Score: 4.0/5.0

Summary: Great product, but slightly misleading: NOT active noise canceling
     This is a superior noise "REDUCING" or "FILTERING" or "SUPPRESSING" earmuff. Noise canceling implies active circuit with a microphone and speakers that generates sound waves opposite to the noise of certain frequency in the area. This product is completely passive. Something worth noting is that if you wear glasses (or sunglasses), this might not work as well as foam earplugs. These earmuffs works by forming a good seal around your ears, and most glasses will compromise the seal. Also, the pressure of the earmuffs on the glasses frame might cause some discomfort.
