Score: 5.0/5.0

Summary: Terrific
     I am just getting into cast iron cookware, after recently dumping my teflon coated stuff. This Lodge product is great. I use a little cooking spray and everything cooks great. Virtually non-stick cooking and everything tastes great. The top part is good for eggs or pancakes and the larger pot for casseroles. Stacks for storage. Easy to clean with a nylon brush and warm water. Highly recommended.
