Summary: I quit slouching in my chair.
     This chair has forced me to sit upright again. It's quite comfortable, I adapted quickly to its style. I didn't have any back issues when I bought this, but I knew that being in front of a computer all day in a conventional chair allowed me to get lazy and slouch. This chair establishes a good structure so my shoulders don't droop and I sit with my back against the backrest. It was easy to assemble and the casters work well on carpet.
