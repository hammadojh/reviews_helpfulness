Summary: Broken within 5 months!!!!
     The watch mechanism is great, but if you're looking for a watch that will last, including the watchband, then look elsewhere. My watchband (all stainless steel) broke at the end and a regular watch repair shop cannot fix it. It must be replaced, so I called/emailed Invicta and their response was that I can PAY for a replacement. The replacement fee was 20% of the MSRP of the watch, which is $255.00 on their website, not including shipping! The warranty that is supposed to be one-year only includes the interior mechanism of the watch. It doesn't include anything that is related to the exterior, including the watchband. I emailed several times to Invicta, and I never got an email reply back. I am extremely disappointed and I thought I was getting a great product that will last. Next time, maybe I should invest my money in something that has a REAL warranty with a real effective customer service department.
