Summary: Warning, bad warranty!
     I bought this watch about 2 years ago. From the start I had difficulty with the screw down crown, upon reading other reviews this is a common problem. When changing the date, I had to press down and turn the crown a number of times before it would "catch" and would screw down. Finally it stripped and will not screw down. I decided to send it back to Invicta as it is under warranty. Estimated repair was $18, but you must also send them a check for shpping and handling for $28. This is in addition to my shipping cost to send to them. BTW the address for Invicta is about 100 miles from me. Shiipping and handling charge is way out of line. To top all this off expected reapair time is 90 days. You must also remember that this is an estimated repair cost. All in all it would cost me at least $50 to repair a watch I bought 2 years ago for $74. I'm going back to wearing my old dive watch that I bought over 25 years ago and never had a problem. BTW my wife had a similar problem with a watch from a differnt manufacturer and it cost her $5 for S&H and all repairs were covered. I should have read the one star reviews on Invicta products before buying this watch, I never would have purchased it.
