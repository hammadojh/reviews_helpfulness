Score: 1.0/5.0

Summary: Agree - Works Inconsistently
     I can agree with D. Baker above. Found the HRM to work inconsistently and above 175 to quit. Also poor recording of low end HR; found the HRM to record 25 beats above my visual checking of the HRM status. RECOMMEND: DO NOT PURCHASE unless you enjoy aggravation.
