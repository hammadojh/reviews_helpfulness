Summary: Great tool, could have been perfect
     I purchased the Leatherman Wave with Leather Sheath when Amazon offered both it and the leatherman micra for 50 USD, and I recommend you wait until that deal comes again as its a bargain for 2 very helpful tools. The Wave is by far one of the best leathermans I've owned, and it blows the Gerber tool I have out of the water. The knife, sawblade, and file tools are all very large and easily accessible with the new design. The hassle of opening the tool to get to the blade is eliminated and it is quite handy. The locking mechanisms of the leatherman are great, very safe and easy to release--which is something I cannot say about my gerber. The knife and tool itself is of very solid construction and durable. Now onto the cons:The leather sheath included with the wave is annoying. Its a very hard leather and I would think a flexible nylon pouch would be better--but this is just a personal preference. The phillips/flat head screw driver tool is both helpful and sturdy, but I feel they could have included a collection of different heads that you would keep in the sheath (my gerber does this). I think you can buy an additional attachment for the tool, but its bulky and cumbersome. I would have liked to have seen the additional screwdriver heads included in compartments of a nylon pouch and just switch them out as needed. However, those cons far do not approach the pros, and I would recommend this tool both to the professional handiman and the occasional fix-it.
