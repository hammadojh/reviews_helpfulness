Summary: New Wave: This Tool Rocks
     When I was a kid I always had a Wenger Swiss knife so this always made me look towards a knife that could do everything. My first Leatherman was the PS1 which I owned for less than 48 hours before I laid it down on the job for less than two minutes and it walked. That was 9 years ago. Did not know the value of what I lost. In those 9 years the Leatherman tool has improved greatly. The New Wave does everything that I always needed when I did not have tools with me. It is a great product. Since most of these reviews are good I will highlight what I would like improved. When I first recieved the tool it seemed as if they forgot to install the lanyard ring. Emailed Leatherman customer service and they told me the lanyard is recessed at the foot of saw looked closer and there it was. That is a very nice feature. My pliers will not shut properly by just closing the handle. They get caught on the inner tools unless I partially close the plier heads. Not a major problem. The can opener/bottle opener is not as fast as a p38 can opener but easily removes the caps off Widmer heffenwiesen. These are the only problems that I can find on this tool. Awesome tool.
