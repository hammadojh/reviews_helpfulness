Summary: NOT FULLY ASSEMBLED
     I was not impressed with this item at all. After taking it out of the packaging, I realized that not only would it not fit my bike, but it also does not come fully assembled as advertised. You have to take out an axle in you bike to be able to insert another piece.... every time you use it. Not convenient at all and more of a risk of damaging your bike in the process. I would not recommend. Also, having difficulties getting a refund because it is taking Amazon FOREVER to process it. If you want to avoid the unnecessary snags in online ordering, do not by this product. I was very disappointed when I realized that the description of the bike online is not accurate.
