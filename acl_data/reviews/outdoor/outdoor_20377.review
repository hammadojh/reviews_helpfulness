Summary: Pleased Customer
     Overall, I am pleased with the product. Considering the cost-effectiveness of this item, I am completely satisfied. It was easy to set-up, but the directions were lacking if you have no prior experience with trainers. It is a bit loud, but after reading the reviews prior to purchase, I was not suprised.
