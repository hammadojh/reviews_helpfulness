Summary: Excellent product and service
     First off, I'm a full-time dad (not an everyday biker)with a new born under six months. Any kind of cardio exercise on my own time right now away from home is practically impossible. So I bought this based on two motives: inexpensive and practical. I believe the price speaks for itself. Right out of the box, this trainer is practically ready to go. Just had to tighten two bolts on the trainer to my bike's rear axle and that was it. The ride is actually very smooth and the noise factor for my budget is bearable. The construction of the trainer feels sturdy and well built. I would be surprised if I didn't get a hundred or more hours out of this. Also want to say, very impressed with Amazon's delivery service. Ordered my trainer yesterday with next day delivery service and within 24 hours it was at my doorstep just as promised.
