Summary: TETON Sports Scout3400 Internal Frame Backpack
     Why is this pack so inexpensive? I thought I was buying this because it looked like a decent pack for the price but I really didn't expect so much. Most quality packs are well over $100 and some even approach $200 for this kind of quality. I was so blown away with the quality construction and all the "extras" that I'm still a little speechless. What's the catch? I dare say this is the best experience I've ever had buying anything online and I buy quite a bit. So if you are wondering if you should buy the Scout3400 backpack by TETON Sports, take my word for it, you'll be incredibly pleased. I can't say enough about how much pack this is for the money. If 6 stars could be given, this one would get it.
