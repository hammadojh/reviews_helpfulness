Summary: birthday present for Bryce
     My review is written while the big flyer is still in the box. It is a present for my Grandson, he will be 4. My first purchase of a big wheel was not this particular one, it was not available at this time, so looking at the reviews, I decided to get this one. I am sure my Grandson will love it, it looks sturdy and hopefully will provide months of fun for my Grandson....My oldest Grandson had the best time with his. I will buy each of my Grandchildren (7) a big wheel when they are 4 years of age, it is a great toy/bike!
