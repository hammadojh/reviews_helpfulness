Summary: Where's the number's
     Purchased Schwinn bike computer after reading many reviews. Received quickly and easily installed. It works great except for one problem. The large number (speed) stays on top. Your small numbers stay on the bottom as you scroll through the different functions. They are very difficult to see, impossible while riding. After your ride you can look up any of the functions you would like. There are others on the market. Hope this helps.
