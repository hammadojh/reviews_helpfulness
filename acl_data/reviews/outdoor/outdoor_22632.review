Summary: Excellent Rack, AMAZON suggesting wrong accesory !!!
     Love the 2 bike rack, love the fact that the bikes are well supported, that you can put bikes that don't have the high bar (like some women's models). Amazon has done a TERRIBLE job bundling this product with the "locking pin". Amazon's wrong suggestion is inducing many people to purchase the wrong locking pin. This generates returns and loss for Amazon, its customers, AND the manufacturer. Stop bundling this rack with the wrong pin.
