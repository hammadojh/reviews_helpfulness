Summary: Amazing Griddle!
     Griddle came yesterday and like all my cast iron I seasoned it. Washed with hot water, dryed it and put a light coating of veggie oil on the entire pan and baked in the oven upside down at 350 degrees for an hour. This extra step is worth it and as long as you do not use soap you do not need to do it again. Used the griddle today to make pancakes and it was completely non-stick. Not only is it healthier to cook with it browns the pancakes much better than a non-stick griddle. Cleanup was easy, just wiped with a paper towel. Lodge is the best!
