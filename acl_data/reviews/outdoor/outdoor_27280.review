Summary: good but not the best
     these are good solid products, . However, the best stainless water bottle out there is made by Guyot. Its got a bigger mouth opening which I find easier to drink AND clean. they are now hard to find and are a bit pricie 20-24.00 but worth it. Amazon, believe it or not, does not sell them. I understand that Nagalene either bought them or has made a liscening deal and they will be distributing them this spring. This may sound a bit thick but stainless is not as durable as plastic and what I find most annoying, you can not tell how much fluid is in there with out peering into the black bottle. Also Naglene makes a non bpa canteen- the old version at 1/10 the price.
