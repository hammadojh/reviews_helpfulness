Summary: little bit of a dribble cup
     After reading recent information about Sigg not sharing info about chemicals used to line the interior of their bottle, we opted to switch to Kleen Kanteen for the stainless steel. There are pros & cons:1) obvious pro - the materials are known to be safe2) the bottles sweat where as the Sigg did not sweat at all3) the mouth of the bottle is large enough for ice cubes but makes it a bit more difficult to drink out of -- kind of like drinking out of a 1qt gatorade bottle --- sometimes a little bit dribbles out.4) My 18month old loves his bottle because its the same color (stainless steel) as his dad's. We got him the sport top instead of the sippy top - and he manages just fine.5) the slim shape fits nicely in most cup holders and water bottle carriers
