Summary: Would NOT recommend!
     I purchased the Schwinn 430 elliptical the end of February. I wanted to get "fit" before my vacation May 9th. Well too bad after 1 month, the machine started making the loudest screeching noise you've ever heard! I called Schwinn (you actually call Nautilus)and we had to try to do a phone diagnosis. The rep then said that I needed a complete new wheel assembly and that a technician would call me to make an appt to come to my home to replace in about one week. Well, it's been 10 days so I called again. Now the rep says, "No the technician only comes after all the parts are delivered to your house, and your parts are on backorder until the middle of May." Great! No one would have contacted me to let me know, and now the machine is basically useless to me. So much for getting "fit" before vacation. Very bad customer service with Nautilus, she wasn't even apologetic at all. I would not purchase this item!
