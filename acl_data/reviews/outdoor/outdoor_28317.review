Score: 1.0/5.0

Summary: Do not order through seller Alice Pipen
     Poor rating due to the shipper; not the product. Buyer beware of buying reburbished items through Alice Pippen. We ordered the set through Alice Pippen via Amazon, and the first 3 discs were completely scratched beyond repair. We contacted Alice Pippen to ask for an exchange of the first 3 or the set or a complete refund within the return policy deadline. We never received any communication back. I repurchased the item brand new via Beachbody and love the product.
