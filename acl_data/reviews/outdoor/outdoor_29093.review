Score: 1.0/5.0

Summary: The DVDs didn't work.
     Paid $100 for this and 1 of 13 DVDs worked. Put in the first DVD and did the exercises. Tried to watch the 2nd DVD to know what to expect the next day and it didnt work. Tried the 3rd, 4th, 5th, etc. None of them worked. To verify it wasn't my DVD player not working I tried the 1st DVD again and it played with no problems. I better get a damn refund.
