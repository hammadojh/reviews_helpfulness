Summary: Yes, another problem on the adjustment.
     Yes, it's a decent speed rope for the money and yes, it's extremely frustrating to adjust. For me, the problem wasn't so much in getting the metal cap off (easily done with a simple, sturdy flathead screwdriver pinned in the center of the tab) nor was it in actually adjusting the length of the rope. The problem was in getting the tab back in the handle. The cylindrical metal tab has to be snug in the handle lest it fly off during your excercise, but OH MYYY! , getting it back in requires an incredible and equal amount of pressure on all sides at the same time. I spent almost an hour before I finally got lucky and was able to push it back in. Good luck! As for the review concerning knots, I can see how they might prove to be cumbersome with the hindering of the motion of the rope. However, I'm not sure why anyone would want to tie knots in the first place. Just cut away the excess rope. Now that my frustration is gone and my rope is fixed, it does a great job.
