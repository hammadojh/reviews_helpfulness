Summary: Bought 2, both Defective - unable to adjust
     I am sure I am following the instructions correctly. I have read all the positive reviews here, and understand what they say about how easy it is to adjust the length. If it is that easy, mine are just defective. I pop the caps off the handle, and try to slide the rope out the opening, but it will NOT budge. The metal cringe is kinda stuck on the top side of the plastic handle, where I cannot reach to even tinker with it. Heck, I bought this after reading the overwhelmingly positive reviews, but have to say that I must belong to the small minority that got saddled with the defective pieces.
