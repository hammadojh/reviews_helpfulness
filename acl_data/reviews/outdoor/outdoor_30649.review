Score: 5.0/5.0

Summary: Go Figure
     I bought this for myself to play with (I'm 35) and after all the presents were opened and toys, video games, and everything were forgotten (about 4 hours after Christmas), this was the ongoing favorite of the season. Everybody, younger (down to 8) and older (to 45) had a blast with this thing after a couple minutes coaching. It's already on everybodys wish lists for upcoming birthdays and such. This is a GREAT present for 11-18 boy. Fair warning though, there will be some good spills on the fairly short, steep learning curve - helmets, knee pads, blah, blah, are a must (and a video camera! )
