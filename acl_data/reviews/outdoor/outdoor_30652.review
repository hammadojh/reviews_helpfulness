Summary: This is contagious!
     Just like most of the other reviews of this product, my 10-year-old absolutely loves it! He mastered it within minutes (he does snowboard which helped) and other neighbor kids and friends have since bought one also. Saved some money by buying it on Amazon rather than in stores. Have only had it several days, but I think this item is money well spent for the fun and excitment we've experienced so far.
