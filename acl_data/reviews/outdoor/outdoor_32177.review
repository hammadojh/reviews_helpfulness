Summary: Ergonomic and effective product
     Aware of constant gimmicks and flat out failure rates from everyone and their dog trying to cash in on the health craze, we were skeptical of this. We took a chance and got a set of them and we are not dissapointed. The work very well and are sturdy, and because you are not destroying the wrists and even knuckles, they are also more effective. They work great because you can dip down a little more and really get a better workout from your arms and chest. I would recommend some mats of some kind if you are using them on carpet, just to save the wear and tear on your floor over time.
