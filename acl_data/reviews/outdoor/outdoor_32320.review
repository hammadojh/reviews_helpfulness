Score: 3.0/5.0

Summary: Good product, but...
     ...I agree with other reviewers that the instructional DVD should be included and not a separate purchase. Having to pay an extra $14.95 for a short instructional video is, I think, a rip off. I love the product, but dislike being milked by the company that markets it.
