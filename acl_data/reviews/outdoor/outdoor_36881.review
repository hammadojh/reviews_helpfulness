Summary: The best value in pedometers, but holder is cheaply made
     This pedometer is about as accurate as you could reasonably expect. The features are suitable and it even looks good. The only problem I have with this product is minor, and it's why I gave the item 4 stars, rather than 5. The plastic holder/belt clip that comes with the pedometer is cheaply made and has a very puny little spring. If you don't plan on using the belt clip, this is definitely a 5 star item. Otherwise, just treat the holder gently and hopefully it will last longer than mine did, because Omron won't sell the holder seperately. The holder is the only weakness to speak of and if Omron redesigns it, this will be 5 stars across the board (For the record,I wouldn't let my opinion of the holder stop me from buying another one. I'd make the same suggestion to anyone who's on the fence - buy it.)
