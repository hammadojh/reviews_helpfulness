Summary: GREAT OUTDOOR TOY
     Our new foam covered Master Pogo has stood up to punishing abuse by my children and thier friends. Contrary to other reviews, our rubber tip shows little sign of wear and will probably last for several more months. Our Pogos rubber tip does look different than our old Master Pogos, so I guess it was redesigned and is much improved. According to my kids, the black and yellow foam covering makes the pogo very comfortable to ride because it doesn't hurt thie inside of their legs. Safety is of course a major concern. I make sure everyone using the pogo wears a helmet. All and all this has proven to be a very durable toy, one that my kids will undoubtedly enjoy for many yeart to come. I hightly recommend it.
