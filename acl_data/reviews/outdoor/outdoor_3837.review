Score: 5.0/5.0

Summary: great!
     I was extremely satisfied. The shipping was BEYOND fast! I got my shoes the next day. My husband has some old blue ones and I wanted to get him ones in black. I checked for his shoe size for Chuck's (since they tend to be a size or a size and a half longer then the normal shoe size).
