Summary: Stopped working after 3 days
     The Omron HJ-720ITC worked great for 3 days. Then it would get stuck and not count any steps, or it would jump huge spans of numbers going from 40 to 80 to 100. It has also started resetting it self back to zero randomly. I do give Amazon support 5 stars. I called them and they are sending me a lable to return the item and I should have the new pedometer in 4 days.
