Score: 2.0/5.0

Summary: Uses batteries like crazy
     The pedometer itself is OK. It tends to overestimate steps, but I don't think a perfect pedometer exists, short of attaching sensors to your legs. As long as you use the same one, it will presumably overestimate all the time, meaning you can at least compare measurements across the same pedometer. My main problem with this pedometer, and the cause for its low score, is how often this thing goes through batteries. I go through a battery every 3 weeks, so in a year, I expect I will go through almost 20 batteries. Yow! The pedometer itself may be relatively cheap, but 20 batteries a year for a glorified wrist watch is an amazing feat. I am not surprised to see that the Omron sometimes gets packaged with a set of replacement batteries. That's not a very good sign ...Anyway, buyer beware.
