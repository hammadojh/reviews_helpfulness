Summary: No product support and does not for jogging
     I picked this pedometer based on research over the web trying to find a recommended device for use when jogging. It was surprisingly difficult to find one that was for jogging versus walking but this one kept coming up. I received it be I am unable to install the software as I get an error. They have no support what so ever. There is a website but when you click on support you fill out a form that ends with 'suggestion form' and you never hear back from any one. So I cannot use the software. The other problem I have is I cannot find any way to start and stop it at a specific time, when I am excercising. It is designed to be worn all the time and just keeps adding up the days total steps. I would not recommend this to a walker or a runner based on the lack of support and limited capabilities.
