Summary: Love this pedometer!
     This is the second pedometer that I have had, and by far the best! The Omron Pocket Pedometer appears to be accurate, and very easy to use. I especially like the fact that there is no need to reset the pedometer each time you walk as it resets itself at midnight each night. I also love being able to download my steps with ease onto the supplied Health Management software. And you don't have to download each day - this unit stores your information! I am very please with this pedometer!
