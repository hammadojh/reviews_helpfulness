Summary: Great weightlifting shoes
     I bought these basically since my other shoes were worn out and I noticed with certain weight lifting routines such as squats and dead lifts my weight would shift easy. I needed something close to the ground and not much cushion and these were it. I found with my other shoes I would start to slowly shift forward or backwards on them since they were so cushioned and I found myself off balance a lot. These shoes cleared that up for me but I will say arch support is almost nonexistant so I had to go find some small inserts because they were kind of uncomfortable at first and these things are kind of thin too. So if you go with inserts make sure they aren't very thick. I highly recommend not running in these since they don't have supports or very much cushion at all. They are good for walking but I cannot imagine running a mile or so in them without crippling foot pain. I didn't buy these at Amazon since I wanted to make sure I liked them before I bought them. I didn't really buy them for any fashion or anything since I could really care less about that. The color is what I like since I really don't like Chuck Taylors that have white and another color. The black was perfect for me since it basic fit my color palette of clothing I wear. My wife says they look good on me so I will take her word for it but than again she may be humoring herself. These were my first pair of Converses and for the price you really cannot go wrong since I can imagine myself hanging onto these for a good amount of time.
