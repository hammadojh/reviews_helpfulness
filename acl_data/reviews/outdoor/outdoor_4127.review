Summary: Quality went downhill while prices went uphill
     I love the classic style but miss the quality and durability of the Converse All Stars. I had All Stars that lasted well over five years. Some pairs I even used the soles to slow down and brake while skateboarding and they still lasted a super long time. The Converse All Stars nowadays are no where near the high quality and durability of before. Grab a pair of the high quality Converse kicks from before and compare them to the quality of today. One way to tell a high quality kick from another is the pinstripe on the sole: the pinstripe on the sole of high quality shoes is thick and solid. While the pinstripe on the Converses of today are thin and weak (and they rip and tear off from my experiences; something that NEVER happened with the quality of before) That's just one indicator. There are many subtle differences that combined make a huge difference in overall quality and durability. The quality went down since Nike bought Converse some time ago (and yet the prices went up). But the style is classic and if you like to wear new-looking Converse, then the Converse of today will do for you. But if you're like me and prefer sporting your kicks dirty and beat-up and for an extended period of time, I suggest you go on Ebay and buy a pair of Converse kicks from before. But you're going to have to bid high because after all, you'll be bidding on high quality and awesome durability, which is something the Converses of today do not have.
