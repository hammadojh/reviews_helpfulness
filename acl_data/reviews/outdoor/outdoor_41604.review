Summary: Not good for cycling
     It's an OK basic monitor that does everything listed in the features list. Two things you might want to know if you're considering this unit for cycle training.1. It does not come with a handlebar mount.2. Once the head unit loses contact with the chest strap, it ends the workout (as opposed to simply pausing it) and will only give you the time of day. The only way to get it to start up again is to clear all the data. This is a real drag if you have it mounted on your handlebar and you need to stop to refill your bottles or fix a flat, or walk away from the bike for any reason. You end up having to take it off the handlebar, wear it on your wrist, and include your "standing-in-line-at-the-store" heart rate into your workout average. This is just too bad. Also, it only has a single display; your current HR. If you want to see the time of day or any other info, you've got to cycle through some buttons. EDIT to add:The recall memory will not tell you the amount of time spent above or below the target zone, only the time in the zone. There is indeed no lap function or countdown timer.
