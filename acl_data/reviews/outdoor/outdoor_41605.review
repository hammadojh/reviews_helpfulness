Summary: Great entry-level HRM--highly recommended
     For an entry-level device this one rocks! I bought this HRM to help my training program and am not disappointed. It works with the cardio equipment at the gym (Lifecycle brand) so I can focus on my workout, not my wrist. Even when I do look at the HRM display, it is large enough to see while running, so bouncing is not a major concern. It may not be the most attractive timepiece, but it works exactly as designed. Add to that the user-changeable battery on the chest strap (Polar and others do not offer this feature) and you have a nice device that will be a great work out partner for years to come. So far, accuracy is solid and the functions that I need are there--plus some I didn't realize I wanted before I had them. I love the post-workout breakdown of max and average HR, time in the zone (that you define), and calories burned (based on your weight and HR). If what you need is a basic, high-quality HRM, this one gets two thumbs up.
