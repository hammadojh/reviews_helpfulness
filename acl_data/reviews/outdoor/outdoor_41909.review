Summary: Pleasantly surprised
     The BodyTrac Glider arrived quickly and assembled easily as the main parts were factory assembled. The aluminum parts are heavy and well finished and the unit is light enough for an 81 year old man to pick up and store against the wall. It is as quiet as a little mouse and as smooth as smooth can be. It is almost like rowing the real thing on the water and far superior to those units that have two straight arms and not a bit like the real thing. People that can't pick the unit up to move will find that it doesn't drag well on carpets, although it can be done. I find no fault in the glider and am using it set on the lowest setting and doubt if I'll ever be able to use the highest number on the hydraulic piston, which offers a great amount of resistance. It is the best exerciser I have ever owned for ease of folding up. It takes less than a minuet to fold the arms back and screw in the two retaining nobs. IT LOOKS GREAT, GREAT QUALITY AND ABOUT AS CLOSE TO THE REAL ROWING MACHINE AS YOU CAN GET.
