Summary: Waiting for Weider
     The Weider Total Body Works 5000 Gym arrived with parts missing. The person in the parts department was not very apologetic and told me it would be 7 to 10 business days before the missing parts arrived. He could care less that they had inconvenienced me. The attitude shows a lack of appropriate customer service. So far Weider is off to a bad start in gaining my fidelity as a customer.
