Score: 1.0/5.0

Summary: Hip Hop Abs
     The product purchased was obviously a copied DVD - as many DVD players will not properly play copies. My copy skipped terribly and was completely unusable. The company did replace my copies, but they still have skipping problems. When the company said the product was "NEW", I didn't understand they meant newly copied. I should have paid full price for the TV ad version.
