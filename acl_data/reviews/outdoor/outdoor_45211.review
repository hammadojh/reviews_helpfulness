Summary: Just 'okay' - leaky
     I got this bottle having read the good reviews about it, but it's really not all that special. The insulator only works for a couple of hours, and there IS a plastic taste that the bottle will pass onto your water. The bottle also has a tendency to leak, even when the top is firmly twisted, and the mouthpiece is loose so it'll slide back down to the 'closed' position while you're drinking so you get air and water when you sip. It's a good bottle for taking around, but only for casual use.
