Summary: Excellent Trainer
     I was searching for a durable quality gripper that took some power to close. I figured that I would have no problem closing the Trainer and figured I would buy the Trainer and the Level One gripper. Glad I bought the Trainer. The Level 1 is pretty tough to close and I like to do it a few times then go work on the Trainer. As for quality like Mr. Baotic said, these are high quality. Now that I have two I want the whole set. I've heard people complain that the grips are a little rough but they don't injure you at all they are just rougher so they don't slip when you sweat. If you want a quality, durable, gripper buy from the Captain's of Crush line. I know I will never go back.
