Score: 5.0/5.0

Summary: Tough
     Definitely not the gripper to start with. This gripper takes 195 lbs. of pressure to close and you will feel every bit of it. I was searching for a durable quality gripper that took some power to close. I figured that I would have no problem closing the Trainer and figured I would buy the Trainer and the #1 gripper. Glad I bought the Trainer. The Level 1 is pretty tough to close and I like to do it a few times then go work on the Trainer. Finally I progressed to the #2. I just received mine 2 weeks ago but I know it'll be a while before I master it. As for quality like Mr. Baotic said, these are high quality. Now that I have two I want the whole set. I've heard people complain that the grips are a little rough, mine weren't that sharp so I have a feeling each unit is different. I understand the theory that they are rougher so they don't slip when you sweat. Like I said I haven't had a problem with them. If you want a quality, durable, gripper buy from the Captain's of Crush line. I know I will never go back. If you are really interested there is a process to get certified for closing the 3rd gripper. I know that's my goal. If you are from the Northwest there is an independent site that certifies people that close the second one and on. It's definitely something to work towards.
