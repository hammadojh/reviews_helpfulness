Score: 5.0/5.0

Summary: Simple and useful
     Clock, chronometer and heart rate monitor: the three basic operations I need at the gym. I haven't compared it yet with other monitors, but I think it's accurate enough. Because of the short range of the transmitter, it hasn't interefered with other people using monitors (not yet, at least), but it allows my trainer to read my heart rate from its wrist monitor when he stands close to me to try to catch the signal.
