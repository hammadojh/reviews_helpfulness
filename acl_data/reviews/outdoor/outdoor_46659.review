Summary: Omron HR-100C Heart Rate Monitor works well
     I am a recent cardiac patient in a rehabilitation program. I wear the monitor each time I exercise, whether on my bicycle at home or at the rehabilitation gym. I have been given a range in which to hold my heart rate (80% of my maximum of 153 per minute)Using the Omron I am able to monitor my rate keeping it between 114 and 126. I find it easy to read as I am exercising and pretty effortless to properly monitor my heart rate.
