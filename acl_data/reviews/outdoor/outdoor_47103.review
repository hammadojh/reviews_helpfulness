Summary: A Waste of Time
     Unfortunately, I was unable to get this monitor to function correctly. Neither was my wife. We both tried it while running, walking, biking and sitting. At times it seemed to be working, but it was seldom. Mostly it showed a slightly elevated pulse that was way off from actual measured with a finger. We even tried several suggestions of wetting the sensor pads, but nothing seemed to help. Maybe we got a malfunctioning unit - but at any rate - it got returned to Amazon.
