Summary: Excellent Product and OUTSTANDING Service
     I bought this for my mother for Christmas, and she loves it. She got a little treadmill for Christmas as well, so she uses it every day. Now my sister wants one! I just wanted to add that my mom had a "slight problem" with the unit when she first opened it, and that problem was due to my mother's... shall we say... lack of technological saavy. The monitor is very easy to use, and my mom did the equivilent of trying to start a car by looking for the crank on the front of the radiator. But she called the company, Omron, and spoke to someone named Raquel, and I think Raquel would have flown to New Hampshire to help my mom out. She was fabulous, and I must say that kind of service is worth a sixth star for this product. Again, my mom loves the monitor enough to pitch it to my sister, so that's a big thumbs-up in my eyes.
