Summary: Came without a plug!!!
     Really?? It was the biggest letdown in my history with Amazon. I ordered the product late Thursday night/early Friday morning and was super surprised to see that I would get it on Saturday. Totally stoked because that's the fastest shipment I've received since being on Prime. However, fast shipment was all for naught. It doesn't matter how fast you get your order if the product is defective or missing the most crucial piece (e. g., the plug that stops the air from coming out of the ball). Come on, TKO. Get your act together. I wish I would have read the other 1 star reviews before my order, since they report the same problem. Buyer beware!
