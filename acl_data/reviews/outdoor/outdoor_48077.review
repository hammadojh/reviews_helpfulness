Summary: Works great!
     I bought one of these thermoses for my son's school lunch. He prefers hot food, and it said it would keep food hot for 5 hours. Plus, I thought it was nice design. Well, it works great and definitely keeps food hot for a long time. I bought a second one for my daughter's lunches. My only complaint so far is that the rubbery parts on the lid and base can discolor, especially with something like tomato sauce.
