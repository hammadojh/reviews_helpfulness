Score: 5.0/5.0

Summary: Good mental exercise
     No instructions came with the leash on how to string it in order to attach it to the pedometer, but that was good because I had to flex my brain muscle a bit to figure it out and it was fun. A pedometer safety leash is a must, as I am sure pedometer users know.
