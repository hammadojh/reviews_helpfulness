Summary: How to avoid squeek and add resistance
     Everyone's claim that this cycle squeeks horribly is true. I'm average weight for a 35 yr old male and I can peddle it while working on the computer with no resistance (no squeek) and you'll get your heart rate up a little bit. I've found that buying one of those exercise rubber bands (the flat wide kind for rehabilitation) and tie one end of a 7-8" strip to a pedal and fit the other end inside the end cap on the tube and repeat for the other pedal, that it actually adds some decent resistance without any squeek. You can buy the bands on amazon for like 6 bucks. The resistance isn't going to substitute for your spin class or anything but if you're just sitting at your desk for hours pedaling, it makes a difference. Really you can't beat the price so with this little modification its well worth it. You might as well throw that little tension screw it comes with out the window.
