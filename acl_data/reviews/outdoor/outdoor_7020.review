Score: 5.0/5.0

Summary: Very nice starter scooter
     I bought this scooter for my 13 yr. old daughter for christmas this year. She loves it. So far the only problem we have had was a bad tube in the tire. We bought a new one at the local walmart. Its a standerd tube so it wasn't hard to find. I rode the scooter and its pretty fun. There is storage under the seat. over all a good scooter for a great price. dw
