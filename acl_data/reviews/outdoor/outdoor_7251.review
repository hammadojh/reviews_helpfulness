Summary: Razor Regrets
     This darling scooter was purchased for a Christmas present and lasted ONE day--you then have to take it to an authorized repair shop where the cost to figure out what is wrong starts at $50. Think long and hard about buying this--you have to charge it EIGHT hours to get 40 minutes of ride time...it dies just as the fun gets started. The warranty starts the second it ships--so, if you are buying it for something special, wait til the last minute. We are disappointed and would not buy again, if given the chance.
