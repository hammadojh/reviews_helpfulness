Score: 5.0/5.0

Summary: Great for the office too!
     As a middle adult geek who grew up on Atari, BMX, MTV and having fun, this thing is great for the office. Why? Well if you have a non-stuffy, no 3 piece suit environment, this is for you. I work in a tech company (big surprise) and we have about 5 of these we use to scoot around the floor on. It's fun and makes going over to a desk or meeting quick. So even though all of us worry about mortgages and layoffs, have some fun and get a scooter. If you buy it for you kid, teach them to wear pads and helmets at all times!
