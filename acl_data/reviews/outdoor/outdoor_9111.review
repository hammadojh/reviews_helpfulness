Summary: Ray-Ban RB2140 Original Wayfarer Sunglasses
     I'm going to start off by saying that I have a very large head. Even as a kid, my parents laughed at how large my head was. I went to my optometrist, and I found that they were selling Ray-Ban Wayfarers, and I was more than excited. However, I looked at the price and limited sizing and was not very interested in paying the $200.00, which does not include the price of the lenses and tinting. I found the 54 mm here for $96.00, and I ordered them immediately. I have always loved the look of Ray-Bans and after purchasing the New Wayfarers as my everyday glasses, I had to complete the set with a pair of the originals as well as the Clubmasters. One of the best features of these glasses is that they aren't so large that they look like they're just completely covering the face. I had to get used to the tilt that the originals have, but I realized that they don't sit so much on my cheeks if I don't put them up the bridge of my nose too much. Another thing that I love is that these are very durable glasses. I wouldn't recommend throwing it around to test it out, as I'm sure they're not indestructable. But the design, construction, and feel of the glasses tell me that these will last a lifetime. Lastly, these glasses will fit any face. The great thing about the Wayfarers is that anyone can wear them. The design is recognizable because of popularity, but also because anyone can wear these glasses. It's a fit that can't go wrong. And with the price and reliability, it's worth the purchase.
