Summary: No real resistance
     I purchased this machine a couple of years ago after seeing it on TV. It doesn't have any resistance to it at all, so basically your just in the air swinging your legs back and forth. I used it for a week about 45 min every day and never once broke out in a sweat or felt like I did anything. I guess if you want to say you worked out without really doing it than this is for you. My advise to others...pass the gazelle up and get something else!
