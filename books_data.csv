     The plot for the book The Giver is very confusing. Their world in this book is all perfect and there is no crime or anything unusual. The beginning you really don't know what is going on because it kind of starts right in the middle of something. There world is totally black and white. The main character Jonas starts out as any normal boy would until the age of 12 when he gets the special job as the Receiver. This person receives all the memories from the people in the past. All the people in this book do not suffer any pain except the receiver. Everybody has the same exact feeling as everybody else and don't get to think for themselves. The second reason is that the plot in this book is not a very interesting topic. This book doesn't grab your attention at all. It is all perfect so there is really no adventure in this book. There also isn't any action in it which makes this book even more boring. This book's plot isn't very thought out in my opinion because it is not very interesting and it is all perfect which makes the reader think the author didn't put much time into thinking the plot through by having the book all perfect. There is what I think about the plot of the book The Giver. So now that you know that this is a very bad book! I want to make sure that you don't waste your well earned money. Thanks for reading about what I have to say about the plot of this book."

     AWESOME book! Originally Tolkien wrote it for his children, now everyone of every age loves it. I don't want to spoil the story, other than it is a really good treasure hunt. If you're stuck on which edition to get, I'd suggest getting the 'classic' one with Tolkien's full-color paintings included. (It's nice and cool, and may be worth something down the road.) On the cover it shows his drawings of the mountains, forest, etc... Enough of that, I just hope they'll adapt this as a movie... (crosses fingers)"

     Did I miss something here? What in the world was this book about? How can anyone say it even has a plot, let alone is worthy of being considered a classic? This pessimistic teenager gets kicked out of school (his third one) for not applying himself. You get the idea that he's smart, but he just doesn't care about anything. There are random references to his dead brother Allie, maybe that's a cause for his disillusionment with the world, but it's never really verified. This story was disappointing in that nothing significant happened. I kept waiting, and turning the pages, but at the end of the day it was a disappointment."

     I've recommended this book to any number of people since coming late in life to it. This is the refutation of Marx's &quot;Communist Manifesto&quot; - the powerful rationalist and ethical argument for capitalism. But you'd be amazed how many supposedly intelligent, open-minded people have told me they REFUSE to read this book because they disagree with its basic premise: that capitalism - the belief that free people creating and freely exchanging wealth - is a moral good, and that communism - the belief that what you create belongs not to yourself, but to everyone else (i. e., government-sanctioned thievery) - is evil. They actually seem AFRAID to read it; they seem to have a lurking, fear that this book somehow threatens some cherished core belief. Who would have thought that simply READING a book could be dangerous?If you read nothing else this year, read this book - if you dare. But know that doing so will put your beliefs about how the world works under a pitiless microscope. And if you read it with any kind of an open mind, it will change the way you think."

     This book is somewhat like an excellent meal--it starts out with a light appetizer in which the reader is introduced to Amir the insecure son of Baba, a wealthy man, and his best friend, Hassan whose father is Baba's servant. The reader is given an inside look at Afghan culture, including the delightful description of the kite-flying contest in which the last one with a kite in the air is the winner and the kites which are cut and fall to the ground are prized possessions for the ""kite runners"". A tragic and violent incident brings on the heavy, main part of the meal, and the lives of the two boys are changed forever. Unspeakable guilt and long-kept secrets work to undermine the happiness of the main characters. The dessert is the sweetness of repentance and redemption, which comes at great cost to some of the characters. The author uses the background of 30 years of political unrest in Afghanistan as a setting for characters whose lives are likewise torn up and re-invented. This is a wonderful book which I highly recommend."

18,book_159993,80.6938635261,11/17,4,"Overcoming Faults
     This book is good read in spite of a host of faults. Its author, Dan Brown, could charitably be described as a mediocre writer of prose. The unfolding of the action moving the plot of the book forward resembles that of a crowded tram rather than a high speed passenger train. Much of this is caused by the many sections of the book where one character or another stops the action to provide an expository of arcane religious symbolism or church history (real and bogus). The paradox is that it is these expositions that make the book so interesting. Brown may be a terrible stylist, but he is a master a blending pieces of authentic information with fictional information. The result of this blending is that his characters actually construct a plausible alternative to the accepted history of Christianity which is at the heart of this novel. Such creations, at least to this reviewer, are always interesting to read about even when as in this case they are completely fictional. Incidentally, for those who think Brown's creation is real, I would suggest reading,the book, ""Truth and Fiction in the Da Vinci Code"" by Bart Ehrman (available at Amazon. com). Ehrman counters the bogus claims made by the characters in this novel with actual historical evidence. For those who enjoy well crafted fictional alternative histories wrapped in a bit of mystery, I would recommend this book."

     A few comments on the book, mostly in response to the negative reviews that have been posted.1) Ayn Rand is clearly not the best writer in the world. Character development and plot within the novel are somewhat lacking.2) Fact (1) above does not take away from the fact that the message is clear and most will find quite enlightening.3) Most negative reviews posted herein appear to be from people who missed the point. COMMMUNIST IDEALS ARE NOT ENVIABLE! 4) The book is a carefully constructed series of events that could potentially transpire, should society forget (3) above. I found the book to be somewhat long and a bit dry at times as well, but it surely rates five stars for being one of the few pieces of literature that I've come across that makes a clear and well-reasoned anti-socialist argument, and does so without having to resort to a wildly fictional backdrop.

     This book may shatter you notion of reality and morals. It is not for the weak or timid. If this is you, please refrain from reading this book. Proceed at your own risk. I had previously read Ayn Rand's ""The Fountainhead"" so I had an idea of what to expect from her works. I went in with high expectations and she completely over exceeded them. Her game is on a whole another level. Although ""The Fountainhead"" is an awesome book, a game changer in it's own right, ""Atlas Shrugged"" is far superior and deeper. This book is over 1,000 pages and took me four months to finish; and I was cheating by listening to the audiobook. The main thing to take away from ""Atlas Shrugged"" is a philosophical understanding of morality and reason. That is the whole essence of the book."

     This book has been recommended to me by several people over the years, and so I finally bought and read it. It's a well written book, a very interesting work of fiction. But I completely disagree with Ayn Rand's philosophy. The lengthy speeches also get to be a bit tedious, the gigantic radio speech made towards the end made me just about pass out from boredom - it seemed to be just the same words all the other characters had spewed out in all of their individual speeches, just strung along and coming out of one character's mouth. Thanks for the recap, Ayn, but I read the words fine the first time. Otherwise, I am fond of Dagny Taggert's character. For some reason I like her practical and &quot;Ice Queenish&quot; outlook on life - this character is quite opposite from me and she was presented well enough that I felt like I could see this world through her eyes. I'm just grateful the world in this book doesn't exist, at least not to this extreme degree.

She then expects (or prompts) the reader to make links from this fantasy world to current culture, and then suggests equally idealistic cures for her ill conceived fantasy world while leading the reader to surmise that the same cures can and should be applied to the real world. This is irrational and dishonest but since you are presented with the straw-man world she has created, what choice do you have except to put the book down and go on within your real world. For those who continue with the book (you'll never get this time back), you find that all the characters that are not selfish enough for her are killed off in a literal train wreck that mirrors the figurative train wreck that is this book. For those who agree that the world will go to hell if all the movers and shakers went on strike, I wonder if they have considered the Lord of the Flies world these beautiful people have moved to. In the land of the blind, the one eyed man is King; and without other Kings, we will get along fine without the richer Kings. We poor employed people just can't live without our employers.

     I can give more than a one star rating to a book I disagree with, but this one is definitely not the one. I tried to read this with an open mind, but could not get far owing to the volume of profanity and absurd reasoning coming out of Al Franken. For example, he notes correctly that the left wing is often called the Hate-America Crowd, and then tries falsely to compare liberals' opposition to President Bush and Iraq with the earlier conservatives' opposition to President Clinton's bombing of the area of former Yugoslavia. His reasoning is silly. To begin with, the Hate America character of the left-wing long predates both administrations. Since time immemorial, left wingers have tried to blame western values and policies for the world's ills. Despite the left wingers valiant efforts, there is no credible evidence that President Bush tried to deceive the American people about Iraq. Current conspiracy theories (Bush motivated by Haliburton, by the Jews and Israel, and-who knows-maybe even motivated by little green men from Mars telling him what to do in foreign policy) are simply fantasies. In contrast, President Clinton had, over and over again, proven himself to be an inveterate liar, and thus totally unworthy of trust in military matters (or, for that matter, any matters)."

Some of the writing is good and Ms. Sebold clearly has talent. However, I found the book to be a difficult read (shifts in tone, unbelievable characters, plodding story-line). I guess it's a story about loss and how it affects various people. I didn't much care about any of the characters so I didn't feel their pain. The first chapter is promising and there are other bits of excellent writing, but as a whole, the novel doesn't work. Maybe she needed a better editor? There are flaws in logic (no one from her neighborhood dies and enters heaven over the eight-year span of the story? the dog dies and shows up in heaven, but not the grandmother?) And I swear some of the sentences just didn't make any sense. The mother/detective relationship was not believable. The detective was incompetent, but romancing the mother? I don't think so. I also had serious problems when the father (thanks to Susie's help) identifies the murderer. In any event, I became bored with the book and struggled to get through it. When it turned sci-fi (Susie inhibits Ruth's body) near the end, I completely lost interest.

The greatest value that was listed in this book was to THINK! to THINK for yourself. To live. To exist. Blindly accepting someone else's arguments without giving them real, actual, rational thought is pointless and worthless. That's why reading this book turns some people into bitter, horrible human beings. They don't know how to rationalize things for themselves, so once they're presented with a compelling argument, they fall into it and grasp hold of it, because they are shapeless, formless, and worthless in and of themselves. Since when does a compelling argument ever give you the excuse to totally abandon your entire previous belief system? Even just ONE example would be God. Yes, objectivist principles are contradictory to many tenets of Christianity. On the other hand, do they in any way prove that the world cannot be the result of intelligent design? Absolutely not. Despite how it may seem, everything has room for expansion of thought.

     The novel The Hobbit by J. R.R. Tolkien tells the story of a hobbit named Bilbo Baggins. He is forced to join a group of dwarves on a quest to reclaim their families' ancient treasure from the evil dragon Smaug. It is a dangerous journey and during the quest it is Bilbo who saves the dwarves on more than one occasion and finds Smaug's weak spot to get back the dwarves' treasure. Although at the beginning of the story Bilbo does not believe he can achieve the dwarves' expectations, he ends up surpassing them. Bilbo becomes the unlikely hero of the group after many an example of his courage and ability to perform under pressure. The Hobbit is a wonderful adventure, fantasy novel which appeals to all ages. It can be read as a straight adventure story by younger readers, or as a more moral story by the older reader. Tolkien has tried to ask a question of the reader: would they rather sit at home and do nothing and have a quiet existance, or go out into the world, get involved and make a difference. I would recommend this book to anyone who has a love of exciting, fantasy and adventure stories. Although The Hobbit is around seventy years old, the underlying themes of the book are ageless."

I will grant that, in its day, the book was probably read as a refreshing challenge to the generally accepted understanding of what it means to be a youth, but, by today's standards, Holden is a seventeen year old kid struggling through a sixth grade existential crisis.

     I was interested in reading &quot;Catcher&quot; due to its history from Mark David Chapman up to its inclusion in &quot;Conspiracy Theory.&quot; As an aspiring writer, I was very impressed and entralled by the style throughout the book. I loved the conversational writing and feel that's at least 50% of the charm of the book. It's very engrossing and very true-to-life. I don't want to read a literary work that reads like a Medical report. Conversations have real language, descriptions, tangents etc --- and &quot;Catcher&quot; is Holden's story of depression. Which brings me to another reason for liking the book.....I can relate to Holden's plight. I'm now 20 and a sophomore in college, but I feel very isolated away from home. I have very few friends at college, and many of my high school friends have changed drastically. I'm changing, too, and I feel like I don't have anyone I can relate to. As &quot;corny&quot; as it may sound, I relate with Holden and his isolation from society. But not everyone will have that relationship with the character. I believe many who read it will find a piece of themselves floating around in Holden's mind, though. Be warned that it is not a &quot;plot&quot; book, as many reviewers have complained. True - It doesn't have a plot, per se, but it is an interesting story that through reading, I think, allows for much self-evaluation while Holden searches for himself and his role in society.

     I was just browsing through the customer reviews of this book, and although I'm sure no one gives a damn about what I have to say (in the rare case that anyone will ever even read this review), I would like to offer my opinions and arguments with those who dislike this book. First of all, the issue of teenage angst is a difficult one to depict in words. It is a difficult one to depict without actually being a teen. Most of the depictions of teenage life these days are rather exploitative. They mostly tell teens how to behave and do not show the true side of adolescence. To those readers who complain that Holden is an &quot;immature malcontent&quot; and so on, teenagers are often immature and often are malcontents. If Salinger led you to believe that Holden is an immature malcontent, then his mission was accomplished. At the current age of 17, I can relate to Holden's character moreso than any other teenager depicted in the media. Although Salinger's style of writing is a little too elementary to be called a &quot;classic,&quot; I feel that Holden Caulfield should be the model for teens. Here we have a character who hates change and wants to be a &quot;catcher in the rye.&quot; When I see children shooting each other, I feel that this is a noble goal for anyone to have. While you are entitled to your opinion, keep in mind that if the world were full of Holden's &quot;phonies&quot; it would be a conformist nightmare. Thank god for people like Holden."

     This book is a work of fiction contradicted by scholarly writing and historical authorities readily avilable. Yet, there is a real danger that readers will take it as historical fact swallowing whole the sensationalist writing, anti-Catholic bent, and conspiracy plots. Based on a perusal of the reviews here, many readers do take the writing as fact! On the one hand, it's laughable that Americans rely on novels and Hollywood movies for an understanding of history. On the other, it is very sad and consequently, Mr. Brown should be embarrassed to propagate so much falseness and bigotry. Most concerning, it mocks all that is revered by Christianity by cloaking inaccurate information as fact. Moreover, it defames and slanders real organizations such as Opus Dei and the Catholic Church by assigning them roles as participants in modern-day criminal and deviant acts. Apparently, it is permissible to write a Catholic-bashing book. In sharp constrast, look at the media frenzy that has arisen surrounding Mel Gibson's The Passion for even daring to depict Jews in a bad light. Would a publisher ever dream of printing such a book about Muslims or Jews?! No. But Catholicism is fair game. The novel itself is poorly written consisting of shallow character devlopment and poorly crafted suspense; it relies on silly riddles and cliff-hangers at the end of ridiculously short chapters to ensure the reader will continue reading (in a book that numbers roughly 450 pages, there are 105 chapters). Overall, I am disappointed that Mr. Brown is making a fortune off unwitting readers."

He endoirses Gnostic Gospels like Thomas to support the idea that Jesus was married when he wasn't, ignoring the fact that the Gospel of Thomas says women must become men to be saved. He claims the Pope shut down the Knights Templar and persecuted them in Rome, when the historical evidence in fact says that the Pope couldn't have persecuted them from Rome because he was in France at the time and the King of France Manipulated the Pope into supressing them. The Pope wasn't the bad guy, it was the king of France etc, etc, etc, etc......ad infinitum. It is another example of a bigot, who because his bigotry is socially acceptable to an athiestic society and media that like to distort the truth, gets a way with publishing bad literature and lying about his scholarship.

Being published in the early 20's, it was certainly a groundbreaking book in its time. At this point, however, while the book is better then some of what is out there, it is given far to much esteem. I found the book, superfluously wordy. The resolution of the plot easy to foresee. And I had a hard time finishing it, I wasn't filled with wonder. Perhaps this is due to my reading a great deal of fantasy previous to reading the Hobbit. I feel the works of HG Wells and Jules Verne have weathered the ages much more effectively.

The bulk of his response was, &quot;The paintings, locations, historical documents, and organizations described in the novel all exist.&quot; Thriller or not, this book is passed off as being historically accurate and full of facts (which has been been commented on by numerous reviewers here and elsewhere).

     Ugh. This was a recent selection in my book club, and apparently everyone else either liked or loved it. I thought it was mediocre at best. In spite of having such a fascinating premise, the execution is deeply disappointing. I felt like it had been written in a Writer's Workshop (or maybe just a fiction writing class at a community college). The symbolism was heavy handed (burning the ties that bind, broken glass/broken lives, etc.) and the writing was very uneven. Sometimes it was careful and well crafted, but more often it was overdone and occasionally it was flat and empty. I'm sure that the scene where she danced with her grandfather in heaven signified some terribly important transition for her, but by then I had stopped caring -- about her or her family, who were a bunch of enigmas. So, her mother is so emotionally fraught that she leaves the family (including her two remaining children) and as far as I can tell pretty much ceases contact with them. Maybe I could accept that. But then, (Spoiler here...skip to next paragraph if you don't want to know) eight years later she finds out her husband is ill, and comes rushing back to them. Sure, the son is sort of mad, but the rest of them embrace her as if she'd been on a long vacation. Would a real family do that? The best-drawn, most believable character in the whole book was the serial killer himself, but his ultimate demise is really kind of silly. Even the people who liked the book found the ending pretty awful. There are so many wonderful books out there. Skip this one and try something like Evening by Susan Minot instead.

Brown included a whole of real research in the novel, but it is mixed in with superstitious conspiracy theories and observations by main characters that look too deep into things.

For those who will read the book, please remember this: Not many researchers beleive Mary Magdalene was married to Jesus, The man sitting next to Jesus in DaVinci's last supper doesn't look like a woman, and there is no evidence that the search for the Holy Grail was the search for the womb of Mary Magdalene, the bloodline of Jesus Christ.

If you like to mix guilt, shame, and violence with your sex, then you'll love Dagny's relationship with Hank Rearden! Ugh!"

     To begin with, I should say that I only read the first 200 or so pages of this book, before being forced to put it down. At the time, I had several friends who had taken up the objectivist philosophy, and I was very interested in it. While reading this book, I became so disgusted with the ideas behind it--as my personal philosophy differs so greatly--that I didn't bother to finish. That being said, this book is excellently well written, and is certainly Ayn Rand's magnum opus. It outlines her philosophical principles in a very literate, intelligent way, and is in it's own way, very gripping. If not for my own great philosophical differences, this book would earn five stars. It just can't be recommended to everyone."

     This is the review I wrote about the original edition:""I have read this book over 10 times, and it is simply the best, most important book ever published! Whether you agree with her philosophy or not does not change the fact that she is mostly right! The story is engaging, and the philosophy she presents wants every reader striving for the best they can be! The moral chaos we live in today needs to be seriously examined, and Ayn Rand knows how to tell it as it is, and conceptualize complex issues into understandable alternatives. Highly recommended, if not for the philosophy, then for the storyline and the highest quality of writing.""My opinion has not changed...."

83,book_70475,90.47571019549999,4/13,5,"A must read classic
     As noted above, Atlas Shrugged is the &quot;second most influential book for Americans today&quot; after the Bible, according to a joint survey conducted by the Library of Congress and the Book of the Month Club, gives you a good starting reference on how enduring the story is, decades after publishing. This is one of the few books I have ever read multiple times. The first couple times as just a great novel, then as societal commentary. So I guess both need to be addressed in a review. As a novel: The story follows Dagny Taggart, executive of a railroad as she struggles, along with other achievers, to succeed while the bulk of the human race stands idle. Eventually, the achievers start disappearing and the resultant society of &quot;looters&quot; begins to fail on a grand scale, without a system of work ethics or morals to guide them. Good character development in the leads, supporting characters are numerous and provide ideas and contrasts more than anything. Provides examination of complex issues, and raised a lot of thought provoking questions. The only downside to the book is the overly long speech by a lead character at the end, otherwise moves along quickly for its' size. As a commentary on society: The storyline parallels today's America to a point, as we become more and more of a welfare state and a society of self-described victims who don't take personal responsibility for our choices to chain-smoke, overeat, etc, etc. I recommend it as a novel, regardless of your take on the philosophical portion because it has a great epic storyline. An even more satisfying read if you are a self-starter or small-businessperson type who has dealt with government bureaucrats and assorted hangers-on."

     Although an oft amusing little tale (I especially liked the Gollum) and although I come to this book late, I have to say that I felt I was reading an Enid Blyton book most of the time, which is by no means a critism because she, above any other author fired my imagination as a child (which begs the question, why is this considered 'classic literature' and not 'The Enchanted Wood' or 'The Magic Far Away Tree')?I'm glad I've read it as it's much talked about, but it certainly wouldn't make me want to go on to read LOTR's. To be fair though I have to say I'm not usually attracted to the fantasy genre and read this because I felt I ought to. That said I thoroughly enjoyed all the Harry Potter books and Philip Pullmans 'Dark Materials' trilogy. I think maybe I just prefer a little human intervention to make things realistic now I'm an adult and parallel worlds are more interesting than gnomes, goblins and elves."

     ...it's shorter and reads better. I managed to get through about three quarters of this very long book, but it finally defeated me. Rand's ideas are worth understanding, but the speechifying finally wore me past patience and stamina. The ""tragic"" heroism of the main characters ceased being interesting pretty early in the book. If only Rand had cut this monster down by a third... the writing might have been tighter; the characters, limited in depth though they are, might have had more sharply drawn and entertaining trajectories; and the terribly dated ""bogey and bacall"" posing might have held me if only for historic and nostalgic reasons. I reached a point where I no longer cared how it all turned out. With no small sense of release I quit this volume for good and will not be back."

     Maybe Rand had something interesting to say. Maybe not. Who can tell? Either way, her trademark novel is so stilted, so drawn out, so hypnotically boring, so irrepressibly repetitive, you'll never make it to the end, I promise. The most laughable part of this novel is her obsession with the Gold standard. Heck, what is gold but a highly conductive non-corroding metal? What is so magical about gold that it might somehow prevent the global economy from crashing and burning due to greed and stupidity? Why not use some other commodity upon which to base a currency? Why not use sand? Why not develop the Sand Standard whereby people deal in tons of sand instead of ounces of gold? Or why not use titanium, or bismuth or pork bellies or dung? This gold thing is just one example of Rand's supposedly ultra-rational view of reality (Objectivism) that turns out, when sufficiently examined, to be little more than some sort of fetish of hers, some kind of personal bias cloaked in a mange of so-called perfect reasoning. It's silly at its best, boring at its worst."
